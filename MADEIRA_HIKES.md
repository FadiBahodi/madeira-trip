## 2026 Booking System (SIMplifica)

### What Changed on January 1, 2026

Madeira's regional government introduced a **mandatory reservation and fee system** for all classified PR hiking trails. This is managed exclusively through the **SIMplifica portal** (simplifica.madeira.gov.pt), operated by the IFCN. There is no cash payment on-site. No reservation = no access.

### How It Works

1. **Create an account** on the SIMplifica portal (free registration).
2. **Select your trail**, date, and a **30-minute entry window** (time slots run from sunrise to sunset).
3. **Pay the fee** online during booking. You receive a digital confirmation/QR code.
4. **Show your confirmation** at the trailhead if checked by IFCN rangers.
5. Each classified trail has a **maximum daily capacity**, and visitor numbers are spread across the 30-minute windows.

### Pricing

| Category | Per Trail Fee | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| General public | **EUR 4.50** | Standard rate for all tourists |
| IFCN protocol operators (RNAVT/RNAAT) | EUR 3.00 | Licensed tour operators only |
| PR1 (Pico do Arieiro to Pico Ruivo) | **EUR 10.50** | Premium trail, separate booking required |
| PR1 via protocol operators | EUR 7.00 | Licensed operators only |
| Children 12 and under | **Free** | Must still be included in reservation |
| Madeira residents (RAM) | **Free** | Must still register and reserve a time slot |
| Disability 60%+ (certified) | **Free** | Must still be included in reservation |

### Multi-Day Passes

| Pass Type | Price | Break-Even Point |
|---|---|---|
| 1-day pass | EUR 9.00 | Saves money at 3+ trails in 1 day |
| 3-day pass | EUR 22.50 | Saves money at 6+ trails in 3 days |
| 7-day pass | EUR 52.50 | Saves money at 12+ trails in 7 days |

**Critical restrictions on multi-day passes:**
- **PR1 is EXCLUDED from all multi-day passes** -- you must book it separately at EUR 10.50.
- Passes require **consecutive days** only.
- Even with a pass, you must book **specific time slots** for each trail.
- A minimum of 2 trails is required for pass activation.
- For most tourists hiking 2-4 trails total, **individual tickets at EUR 4.50 each are cheaper and more flexible**.

### Practical Tips for Booking

- **Book early**: PR1, PR6, PR8, PR9, and PR11 are the fastest-selling trails, especially on weekends and peak season (April-October).
- **Book as soon as your dates are confirmed**: Popular morning slots (8:00-10:00 AM) sell out days or weeks in advance during summer.
- The portal interface is available in Portuguese and English.
- If you need to cancel, check the IFCN refund policy on the portal (policies may change).
- **Screenshot your QR code** in case you lose mobile signal at remote trailheads.

### What Happens If You Don't Book

Rangers patrol popular trailheads. Without a valid SIMplifica reservation, you will be turned away. There is no way to pay on-site. Do not show up hoping to walk in.

## PR1 - Vereda do Areeiro

**Pico do Arieiro (1,818m) to Pico Ruivo (1,862m)**

### 2026 Status: CLOSED (Expected Reopening April 2026)

The PR1 has been closed since the devastating wildfires of August 2024, which damaged large sections of the Central Mountain Massif. Restoration work includes debris removal, vegetation cutting, step rebuilding, and installation of new safety railings across more than 17 kilometres of trail.

**Currently accessible:** Only the first **1.2 km from Pico do Arieiro to Pedra Rija** is officially passable. This short section includes the famous "Stairway to Heaven" viewpoint (approximately 30 minutes from the Pico do Arieiro car park). Sections past Pedra Rija toward Pico Ruivo remain closed and barricaded.

**When it reopens (April 2026):** PR1 will require a separate booking at EUR 10.50 (general public) or EUR 7.00 (protocol operators). It is excluded from all multi-day passes.

### Trail Details (When Open)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 7 km one-way (11 km including spurs) |
| **Elevation gain** | ~790m total ascent (undulating: multiple descents and climbs) |
| **Highest point** | 1,862m (Pico Ruivo summit) |
| **Lowest point** | ~1,420m (valley between peaks) |
| **Time** | 3.5-5.5 hours one-way |
| **Difficulty** | Hard |
| **Trail type** | Point-to-point |
| **Trail surface** | Stone steps, paved paths, rock-cut corridors, exposed ridges |
| **Tunnels** | 5 tunnels (longest ~150m) |

### Difficulty Explanation

This is Madeira's most famous and most physically demanding classified trail. The difficulty comes not from any single brutal climb but from the **relentless undulation**: you descend hundreds of metres only to climb back up again, repeatedly. The trail traverses narrow ridges with sheer drops on both sides, carved staircases, and dark tunnels. Exposure to wind and sudden cloud cover at 1,800m adds to the challenge. Fitness, proper footwear, and respect for weather conditions are essential.

### Transport Logistics

PR1 is **point-to-point**, which creates a transport puzzle:
- **Start**: Pico do Arieiro car park (accessible by car, taxi, or tourist shuttle from Funchal).
- **End**: Pico Ruivo (no road access). From the summit, you must either:
  - Return the same way (making it a 14km+ round trip), OR
  - Descend via PR1.2 to Achada do Teixeira car park and arrange a taxi or second car there, OR
  - Continue via PR1.3 (Vereda da Encumeada) to Encumeada pass (also closed as of Feb 2026).
- **Most common strategy**: Two-car shuttle (leave one car at Achada do Teixeira, drive the other to Pico do Arieiro) or book a taxi transfer.
- **Guided tours**: Many operators in Funchal offer guided PR1 hikes with return transport included.

### Key Highlights

- The "Stairway to Heaven" -- a dramatic descending staircase along a knife-edge ridge with drops on both sides.
- Ninho da Manta (Buzzard's Nest) viewpoint at 1,818m -- a suspended viewing platform in the clouds.
- Walking above the cloud line -- on clear mornings, you are literally above the clouds.
- 360-degree summit views from Pico Ruivo.
- Five tunnels carved through volcanic rock.

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Early morning (sunrise is iconic from Pico do Arieiro). Start by 7:00-8:00 AM to beat crowds and afternoon clouds.
- **Best months**: May-October for the driest conditions, though clouds can roll in any month.
- **Crowd level**: Extremely high (this is Madeira's number-one hike). Even with the 2026 slot system, expect company.
- **Cloud risk**: Afternoon cloud cover is very common. Starting early means you get views before the clouds roll in.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Vertigo-inducing exposure**: Several sections have sheer drops of hundreds of metres with only cable railings.
- **Weather**: Temperatures at 1,800m can be 10-15C cooler than Funchal. Wind, fog, and rain can appear rapidly.
- **Tunnels**: Dark, unlit, wet floors. Headlamp or strong phone flashlight essential.
- **Hypothermia risk**: In rain and wind at altitude, layers and a waterproof jacket are mandatory.
- **No mobile signal** on parts of the trail.

### Water and Facilities

- **Pico do Arieiro**: Cafe and toilets at the car park.
- **On trail**: No water, no facilities whatsoever for the entire traverse.
- **Pico Ruivo summit shelter**: Basic shelter building, no running water, no shop.
- **Achada do Teixeira**: Small snack bar and toilets (if exiting via PR1.2).
- **Bring**: Minimum 1.5-2L of water, snacks, sun protection, warm layers.

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.7/5 (across multiple listings with 3,700-4,000+ reviews for various segments)
- **Listed as**: Hard
- **Note**: AllTrails shows the full trail as "[CLOSED]" in its current listing. Reviews praise it as the best hike on Madeira and one of the best in Europe.

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

The universal consensus across travel blogs, Reddit r/travel, and r/solotravel is that PR1 is the **single must-do hike on Madeira** -- the one trail you plan your entire trip around. However, many recent posts (2025-2026) express frustration about the extended closure. The common advice is: if PR1 is closed during your visit, do PR1.2 from Achada do Teixeira instead (you still summit Pico Ruivo). Reddit users consistently recommend starting at sunrise, bringing layers, and noting that the AllTrails elevation data is unreliable due to tunnel passages confusing GPS.

## PR1.2 - Vereda do Pico Ruivo

**Achada do Teixeira to Pico Ruivo (1,862m)**

### 2026 Status: OPEN

PR1.2 is fully open and is currently the **only way to summit Pico Ruivo** while PR1 remains closed.

### Trail Details

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 2.8 km one-way (5.6 km round trip) |
| **Elevation gain** | ~370m |
| **Highest point** | 1,862m (Pico Ruivo summit) |
| **Lowest point** | 1,491m (Achada do Teixeira) |
| **Time** | 1.5-3 hours round trip |
| **Difficulty** | Moderate |
| **Trail type** | Out-and-back |
| **Trail surface** | Well-maintained stone steps, paved path, some rocky sections near summit |
| **Tunnels** | None |

### Difficulty Explanation

This is a straightforward uphill walk on a well-maintained stone path. The difficulty is moderate primarily because of the altitude (you start at nearly 1,500m and climb to 1,862m) and the steepness of some sections. There are no technical sections, no exposure to sheer drops, and no tunnels. Suitable for reasonably fit hikers of all ages, including older children. The path is wide enough that you never feel exposed.

### Transport Logistics

- **Loop**: No. This is an out-and-back trail.
- **Access**: Drive to **Achada do Teixeira car park** via ER 218 from Santana. The road is paved but narrow and winding. Parking is free but limited (arrive early).
- **No public bus** to Achada do Teixeira. You need a rental car or taxi.
- **From Funchal**: Approximately 1 hour drive via VE4 and ER 101 to Santana, then ER 218 up to Achada do Teixeira.

### Key Highlights

- **Pico Ruivo summit**: 360-degree panoramic views -- the highest point on Madeira. On clear days you can see Porto Santo island.
- **Homem em Pe (Man on Foot)**: A distinctive basalt rock formation near Achada do Teixeira, resembling a standing human figure.
- **Above the clouds**: Like PR1, you are frequently above the cloud line, especially in the morning.
- **Sunrise/sunset**: Both are extraordinary from the summit.

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Early morning (7:00-8:00 AM arrival at car park) for clearest views and fewer people.
- **Best months**: Year-round, but May-October for driest conditions.
- **Crowd level**: High, especially with PR1 closed (all summit-seekers funnel through PR1.2). Weekends are packed.
- **Pro tip**: Sunset hikes are less crowded than morning, but you need a headlamp for the descent.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Altitude weather**: Same concerns as PR1 -- cold, wind, fog can appear rapidly at 1,800m+.
- **No exposure/vertigo risk**: Unlike PR1, this trail is wide and safe.
- **Slippery when wet**: Stone steps can be slick after rain.
- **Limited mobile signal** near the summit.

### Water and Facilities

- **Achada do Teixeira**: Small snack bar (seasonal hours) and basic toilet facilities.
- **Pico Ruivo shelter**: Stone shelter building at the summit, no water, no shop.
- **Bring**: At least 1L of water, warm layers, sun protection.

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.6/5 (4,077 reviews)
- **Listed as**: Moderate to moderately challenging
- **Reviews highlight**: "Simply magnificent, with phenomenal views all along the way." "At the summit, it's 360 degrees, with scenery that will remain engraved in your memory."

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

With PR1 closed, PR1.2 has become the default "bucket list" hike on Madeira for 2025-2026. Bloggers consistently note that while it lacks the drama and challenge of the full PR1 traverse, the summit views are identical since you end up in the same place. Reddit users recommend combining it with the drive to Achada do Teixeira as a half-day activity, leaving the afternoon free for a levada walk or beach time. The road to Achada do Teixeira itself offers beautiful views and is worth stopping for photos.

## PR6 - Levada das 25 Fontes

**Rabacal to the 25 Fontes Waterfall Basin**

### 2026 Status: OPEN

One of Madeira's most popular and iconic levada walks. Fully open and operating under the new SIMplifica booking system.

### Trail Details

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 4.3 km one-way (~9-11 km round trip depending on route) |
| **Elevation gain** | ~300m (mostly on the return uphill) |
| **Highest point** | 1,290m (near Rabacal) |
| **Lowest point** | ~900m (25 Fontes basin) |
| **Time** | 3-4 hours round trip |
| **Difficulty** | Moderate |
| **Trail type** | Out-and-back (with PR6.1 detour option) |
| **Trail surface** | Levada path (narrow concrete/earth alongside water channel), stone steps, forest floor, wet rock near waterfalls |
| **Tunnels** | 1 major tunnel (~800m long, pitch black, wet) |

### Difficulty Explanation

The moderate rating comes from a few factors: the descent to the 25 Fontes is easy, but the return is a sustained uphill climb of about 300m that can tire casual walkers. The levada path is narrow in places (60-80cm wide) with a drop on one side. The 800m tunnel near the start is dark, wet, and requires ducking in places -- this is the adventurous part. Some sections near the waterfall basin are slippery from spray. However, there are no technical climbing sections, and the path is well-maintained overall.

### Rabacal Shuttle System

This is important: **you cannot drive down to Rabacal itself.** The narrow, steep road from the ER 105 plateau parking down to the Rabacal trailhead is **closed to private vehicles**. Here is how access works:

1. **Drive to the Rabacal car park** on the ER 105 plateau (Paul da Serra). Parking is free (gravel/dirt lot).
2. **Take the shuttle minibus** from the car park down to the Rabacal trailhead:
   - **Cost**: EUR 3 down, EUR 2 up (per person, cash payment to driver).
   - **Operating hours**: Daytime only (roughly 9:00 AM to 5:00-6:00 PM, varies seasonally). The shuttle does NOT run early morning.
   - **Frequency**: Every 15-20 minutes when demand is high.
3. **Alternative**: Walk down the paved road from the car park to Rabacal (about 2.3 km, 30 minutes downhill, steep uphill return). Many hikers walk down and take the shuttle up.
4. **Early birds**: If you want to start before the shuttle runs, you must walk the road. This adds ~45 minutes round trip.

### Transport Logistics

- **Loop**: No. Out-and-back from Rabacal.
- **Access**: The Rabacal car park is on the **Paul da Serra plateau**, about 45 minutes drive from Funchal via VE4 and ER 110. The plateau road (ER 105/110) is high-altitude and can be foggy.
- **No public bus** to Rabacal. Rental car or organized tour only.
- **Combine with PR6.1**: Same starting point. Most hikers do both (see PR6.1 section below).

### Key Highlights

- **Lagoa das 25 Fontes**: A stunning natural pool fed by 25 springs cascading down a moss-covered rock wall. The "25 Fontes" (25 Springs) is one of Madeira's most photographed locations.
- **Laurissilva forest**: UNESCO World Heritage ancient laurel forest, dripping with moss, ferns, and endemic species.
- **The 800m tunnel**: An adventure in itself -- walking through a pitch-black, hand-carved tunnel with a water pipe running alongside you. The tunnel was blasted with dynamite to channel water through the mountain.
- **Risco waterfall detour**: By combining with PR6.1, you also see Madeira's tallest waterfall (see below).

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Arrive at the car park by 8:30-9:00 AM. If you want to beat crowds entirely, walk the road down before the shuttle starts.
- **Best months**: Year-round (the laurel forest is always green and atmospheric). Winter months (Nov-Feb) are quieter but wetter.
- **Crowd level**: Very high. This is one of Madeira's top-3 most visited trails. The narrow levada path makes congestion painful -- you will be squeezing past people coming the other direction on busy days.
- **Weekend vs weekday**: Significantly less crowded on weekdays.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Tunnel**: 800m of pitch darkness. Bring a headlamp (phone flashlight works but is awkward). Puddles inside, low ceiling in places -- watch your head. The tunnel is safe but claustrophobic.
- **Narrow levada path**: Some sections are 60cm wide with a drop on one side (not sheer cliff, but enough to injure).
- **Slippery surfaces**: Wet rock near waterfalls, muddy sections in the forest after rain.
- **Return uphill**: Not dangerous, but tiring. Allow enough time and water.
- **Fog on Paul da Serra**: The plateau road can be extremely foggy. Drive slowly.

### Water and Facilities

- **Rabacal**: Basic toilet facilities at the Rabacal rest house. No cafe or shop.
- **On trail**: No facilities.
- **Car park (ER 105)**: No facilities at the parking area itself.
- **Bring**: At least 1.5L of water, snacks, headlamp, rain jacket.

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.5/5 (3,225+ reviews)
- **Listed as**: Moderate
- **Common praise**: "Magical forest," "the waterfall pool is surreal," "the tunnel is an adventure."
- **Common complaints**: "Too crowded," "narrow path makes passing difficult," "underestimated the uphill return."

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

Universally recommended as a top-3 Madeira hike. Blog consensus: do this trail early morning on a weekday if possible. Reddit users consistently warn about the crowds and the narrow path -- "like a highway of tourists in July." The 800m tunnel divides opinions (some love the adventure, others find it claustrophobic and skip it by taking the Vereda da Amelinha route instead). Most bloggers recommend combining PR6 + PR6.1 as a single morning excursion.

## PR6.1 - Levada do Risco

**Rabacal to Risco Waterfall Viewpoint**

### 2026 Status: OPEN

The easiest trail in this guide and the perfect add-on to PR6.

### Trail Details

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 1.5 km one-way (3 km round trip) |
| **Elevation gain** | Minimal (~50m) |
| **Highest point** | ~1,288m |
| **Lowest point** | ~1,000m |
| **Time** | 30-45 minutes one-way (1-2 hours round trip with viewing time) |
| **Difficulty** | Easy |
| **Trail type** | Out-and-back |
| **Trail surface** | Wide, well-maintained levada path, some stone steps |
| **Tunnels** | None |

### Difficulty Explanation

This is genuinely easy. The path follows a wide, flat levada with minimal elevation change. Suitable for families with young children, elderly visitors, and people with limited mobility (though it is not wheelchair-accessible due to some uneven stone sections). There are no narrow or exposed sections. The only "difficulty" is the walk back uphill, which is gentle.

### Transport Logistics

- **Same starting point as PR6**: Rabacal (via shuttle or road walk from ER 105 car park). See PR6 section for shuttle details.
- **Loop**: No. Out-and-back.
- **Natural combination**: PR6.1 branches off from the main PR6 trail near Rabacal. Most hikers do PR6.1 first (detour to Risco waterfall, 30-40 min return), then continue on PR6 to the 25 Fontes.

### Key Highlights

- **Risco Waterfall**: The tallest waterfall on Madeira, plunging approximately 100m vertically down a sheer rock face into a green valley below. Viewed from a spectacular viewpoint/balcony.
- **Laurissilva forest**: Same UNESCO Heritage forest as PR6.
- **Ease of access**: One of the few Madeira highlights accessible to nearly everyone.

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Morning, combined with PR6.
- **Crowd level**: Moderate to high (everyone doing PR6 also does this).
- **Pro tip**: If you only have 1 hour at Rabacal, do PR6.1 -- you get the biggest payoff for the least effort.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Minimal danger**. The path is wide and well-maintained.
- **Wet and slippery** near the viewpoint after rain.
- Same fog warnings for the Paul da Serra drive.

### Water and Facilities

- Same as PR6 (Rabacal rest house has basic toilets, no cafe).

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.4/5 (543 reviews for the standalone PR6.1 listing)
- **Listed as**: Easy
- **Reviews**: "Short and sweet," "the waterfall is breathtaking," "perfect for families."

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

Everyone says: do this as part of your PR6 visit, not as a standalone trip (you are already at Rabacal, and it only adds 30-40 minutes). The Risco waterfall itself is universally praised. Some bloggers note it can be underwhelming in late summer when water flow is lower. Reddit consensus: "Don't skip Risco when you do 25 Fontes."

## PR8 - Vereda da Ponta de Sao Lourenco

**Baia d'Abra to Cais do Sardinha (Eastern Peninsula)**

### 2026 Status: OPEN

Madeira's highest-rated trail on AllTrails and arguably its most visually dramatic coastal walk.

### Trail Details

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 7.4 km round trip |
| **Elevation gain** | ~412m (cumulative, undulating) |
| **Highest point** | ~170m |
| **Lowest point** | Sea level |
| **Time** | 2.5-4 hours round trip |
| **Difficulty** | Moderate |
| **Trail type** | Out-and-back |
| **Trail surface** | Dirt path, volcanic rock, stone steps, some scrambling sections |
| **Tunnels** | None |

### Difficulty Explanation

The moderate rating is appropriate. There is no single punishing climb, but the trail undulates constantly -- up and down over volcanic ridges. Some sections involve light scrambling over rocks. The primary challenges are **wind exposure** (this peninsula is one of the windiest spots on Madeira), **sun exposure** (virtually no shade for the entire trail), and **uneven footing** on volcanic rock. The trail narrows in places along cliff edges, which may bother those uncomfortable with heights.

### Transport Logistics

- **Loop**: No. Out-and-back.
- **Access**: Drive to **Baia d'Abra car park** at the eastern tip of Madeira, near Canical. About 30-40 minutes from Funchal via VE2 motorway.
- **Parking**: Free but limited. Arrive by 8:30 AM to guarantee a spot. On busy days, overflow parking lines the road.
- **Public bus**: SAM bus 113 from Funchal to Canical, then a short taxi or walk. Not ideal.
- **Self-guided transfer services**: Several operators offer drop-off and pick-up from Funchal (cheaper than a full guided tour if you want independence).

### Key Highlights

- **Volcanic lunar landscape**: Unlike anything else on Madeira. Red, ochre, and black volcanic rock formations against the deep blue Atlantic. It looks like another planet.
- **Dramatic cliff views**: Sheer cliffs dropping into the ocean on both sides of the narrow peninsula.
- **Casa do Sardinha**: A small staffed building (formerly a ranger station) about two-thirds along the trail, with a cafe, food, drinks, and paid toilets (EUR 1).
- **Pico do Furado**: The viewpoint at the far end, overlooking the Deserta islands.
- **Wildlife**: Classified Partial Nature Reserve. Home to one of the largest seagull colonies in the region, plus protected seabirds (shearwaters, Bulwer's petrels). With luck, you may spot Mediterranean monk seals in the water below.
- **Optional beach access**: A side path leads down to a small pebble beach where swimming is possible (check conditions).

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Arrive by 8:00-8:30 AM. Sunrise hikes are spectacular and nearly empty.
- **Best months**: Year-round. Spring (March-May) has wildflowers. Summer is hot and exposed. Winter can be very windy.
- **Crowd level**: Extremely high. This is the most popular trail on Madeira. The 2026 booking system helps somewhat, but the trail is still packed by mid-morning.
- **Heat warning**: In summer (June-September), the lack of shade makes midday unbearable. Bring a hat, sunscreen, and extra water.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Wind**: Ponta de Sao Lourenco is exceptionally windy. Strong gusts near cliff edges are dangerous. Avoid loose clothing and hats that can blow away. On very windy days, consider postponing.
- **Sun/heat exposure**: No shade whatsoever. Sunburn and heat exhaustion are real risks in summer.
- **Cliff edges**: Some sections are narrow with steep drops. Stay on marked paths and inside railings.
- **Slippery volcanic rock**: Some scrambling sections can be treacherous when wet.
- **No rescue access**: Parts of the peninsula are remote. A fall here is serious.

### Water and Facilities

- **Trailhead (Baia d'Abra)**: No permanent facilities. Food trucks sometimes set up from mid-morning selling water, ice cream, and snacks. There was a porta-potty but it has been unreliable (sometimes locked).
- **Casa do Sardinha** (mid-trail): Cafe with sandwiches, quiches, pies, and drinks. Toilets (EUR 1 per person). This is the only facility on the trail.
- **Bring**: Minimum 1.5L of water per person (2L+ in summer), sun hat, sunscreen, windproof layer.

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.7/5 (6,999+ reviews)
- **Listed as**: Moderate
- **This is the highest-rated PR trail on AllTrails.**
- **Reviews**: "Breathtaking," "like walking on Mars," "the most stunning coastal walk I've ever done." Negative reviews focus on crowds and wind.

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

Every single Madeira hiking blog lists PR8 in the top 3. Reddit consensus is that it is the most photogenic trail on the island and the one that generates the most dramatic photos. Common advice: go at sunrise (the light is extraordinary), bring way more water than you think, and respect the wind. Some Reddit users note that the trail feels "touristy" by 10 AM and recommend avoiding weekends entirely. The cafe at Casa do Sardinha is universally praised as a welcome surprise.

## PR9 - Levada do Caldeirao Verde

**Queimadas to Caldeirao Verde Waterfall**

### 2026 Status: OPEN (Verify Before Visit)

PR9 is one of Madeira's great levada walks and is currently listed as open, though it has experienced intermittent closures due to landslides and fire damage in recent years. Always verify status on the SIMplifica portal before booking.

### Trail Details

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 8.7 km one-way (17.4 km round trip) |
| **Elevation gain** | Minimal (~100m net, mostly flat levada) |
| **Highest point** | ~1,000m |
| **Lowest point** | ~850m |
| **Time** | 5-7 hours round trip (to Caldeirao Verde and back) |
| **Difficulty** | Moderate |
| **Trail type** | Out-and-back |
| **Trail surface** | Levada path (narrow, flat), rock-cut sections, wet tunnel floors |
| **Tunnels** | 4 tunnels (ranging from short to ~200m) |

### Difficulty Explanation

The trail itself is almost perfectly flat -- you are following a levada (irrigation channel) that was engineered to maintain a constant gradient. The difficulty comes from: (1) the sheer length (17.4 km round trip is a long day), (2) the four dark, wet tunnels requiring headlamps, (3) some narrow sections of levada path with drops on one side, and (4) the return journey on tired legs. There is no technical climbing. The rating should be "moderate" for fitness but "easy" for technical difficulty.

### Transport Logistics

- **Loop**: No. Out-and-back from Queimadas.
- **Access**: Drive to **Queimadas Forest Park** (also called Parque Florestal das Queimadas), near Santana. About 45-50 minutes from Funchal. The last stretch of road is narrow and winding.
- **Parking**: Free at Queimadas. Limited spaces. Arrive early.
- **No public bus** to Queimadas. Rental car, taxi, or tour.
- **Optional extension**: From Caldeirao Verde, the trail continues to **Caldeirao do Inferno** (another 2.8 km one-way, adding ~2 hours). This extension involves more tunnels and a wilder, less-maintained path.

### Key Highlights

- **Caldeirao Verde ("Green Cauldron")**: A 100m waterfall plunging into an emerald-green pool surrounded by a natural amphitheatre of vertical rock walls covered in ferns and moss. One of Madeira's most spectacular natural sites.
- **Four tunnels**: Each one is an adventure -- dark, dripping water, standing water on the floor, low ceilings in places. The 2nd tunnel (~2 minutes walk-through) and 3rd tunnel (~3 minutes) are the longest and have significant standing water.
- **Levada engineering**: Walking alongside a centuries-old irrigation channel carved into sheer rock faces. In some sections, the levada path is cut directly into vertical cliff walls.
- **Laurissilva forest**: Dense, ancient laurel forest for much of the route.
- **Wildlife**: Fish visible in the clear levada water. Endemic birds in the forest.

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Start early (8:00-8:30 AM) to have the trail mostly to yourself on the outbound journey. Crowds build from 10:00 AM.
- **Best months**: Year-round. Slightly less water flow in late summer.
- **Crowd level**: High. This is one of Madeira's top-5 most popular trails. The narrow levada path makes passing other hikers awkward and frustrating.
- **Pro tip**: Weekdays are significantly less crowded. If doing the Caldeirao do Inferno extension, the crowds thin dramatically past the Green Cauldron.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Tunnels**: Dark, wet, slippery, low ceilings. Bring a proper headlamp (not just a phone). Watch your head -- some passages are very low. Standing water can be ankle-deep.
- **Narrow levada path**: Some sections are 50-70cm wide with a significant drop on one side (not always protected by railings).
- **Rockfall**: Rare but possible, especially after heavy rain. Helmets are not standard but some guided tours provide them.
- **Length**: 17.4 km is a long day. Bring sufficient water and food. Tired legs on the return can lead to stumbles on the narrow path.
- **Vertigo**: Some cliff-side levada sections may bother acrophobic hikers.

### Water and Facilities

- **Queimadas**: Picnic area with tables, basic toilet facilities. The Queimadas forest house (traditional thatched-roof building) is a landmark but not a cafe.
- **On trail**: No facilities whatsoever for the entire 17.4 km round trip.
- **Bring**: Minimum 2L of water, lunch/substantial snacks, headlamp, waterproof jacket, spare socks (your feet WILL get wet in the tunnels).

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.6/5 (4,214+ reviews)
- **Listed as**: Moderate
- **Note**: AllTrails elevation gain figures (4,668 ft reported) are wildly inflated due to GPS errors in the tunnels. The actual trail is nearly flat.
- **Reviews**: "The green cauldron is one of the most magical places I've ever seen." "The tunnels are incredible but scary." "Bring a headlamp, not just your phone."

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

Consistently ranked alongside PR1 and PR8 as a top-3 Madeira hike. Blog consensus: the tunnels are the highlight for adventurous hikers but a deal-breaker for claustrophobic ones. Reddit users consistently warn that the AllTrails elevation data is wrong (the trail is flat, GPS goes haywire in tunnels) and that you should not underestimate the distance -- 17 km is a full day, not a casual morning stroll. Multiple Reddit threads recommend bringing spare socks because your feet get soaked in the tunnels. The Caldeirao do Inferno extension is praised by Reddit users who have done it ("way fewer people, even more dramatic scenery") but warned against for those short on time.

## PR10 - Levada do Furado

**Ribeiro Frio to Portela**

### 2026 Status: CLOSED (Landslide Damage)

As of late 2025 / early 2026, PR10 is **temporarily closed** due to a landslide between Ribeiro Frio and Lamaceiros that caused pavement collapse. No confirmed reopening date. Check the SIMplifica portal and IFCN website before planning.

### Trail Details (When Open)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 11 km one-way |
| **Elevation gain** | ~200m net descent (starts higher, ends lower) |
| **Highest point** | ~860m (Ribeiro Frio) |
| **Lowest point** | ~550m (Portela) |
| **Time** | 4-6 hours one-way |
| **Difficulty** | Easy to Moderate |
| **Trail type** | Point-to-point |
| **Trail surface** | Levada path, forest floor, some paved sections near Portela |
| **Tunnels** | Several short tunnels (none longer than 30m) |

### Difficulty Explanation

PR10 is one of the easier long levada walks. The path follows the levada contour with minimal elevation change for most of its length. There is no great physical challenge other than the distance (11 km one-way). A couple of up-and-down sections break the levada's contour as it navigates hillsides. The final descent into Portela is steeper. The tunnels are all short and reasonably well-lit. This is a trail where the difficulty comes from duration, not technicality.

### Transport Logistics

- **Point-to-point**: This is the key challenge. You start at Ribeiro Frio and end at Portela, 11 km away with no circular return option.
- **By bus (the big advantage of PR10)**: This is one of the only top-tier Madeira hikes accessible by public bus.
  - **Bus 56** from Funchal terminal to Ribeiro Frio (EUR 2.60, drops you at the trailhead).
  - From Portela at the end, walk down to **Machico** and catch a bus back to Funchal.
  - Alternatively, arrange a taxi pickup from Portela.
- **By car**: Leave car at Portela, taxi to Ribeiro Frio to start, walk back to your car.
- **Pro tip**: Most hikers walk Ribeiro Frio to Portela (net downhill). Walking the other direction is uphill and less pleasant.

### Key Highlights

- **Laurissilva forest immersion**: 11 km through the heart of Madeira's UNESCO Heritage ancient laurel forest. The forest here is dense, atmospheric, and dripping with moisture.
- **Ribeiro Frio ("Cold River")**: The starting hamlet is charming -- a trout farm, a few cafes, and the start of both PR10 and PR11.
- **Short tunnels**: Photogenic rock-cut passages with fern-draped entrances.
- **Small waterfalls**: Several along the levada route.
- **Portela viewpoint**: Stunning views of the northeast coast as you approach the end.
- **Minimal crowds**: Compared to PR6 and PR9, this trail is significantly quieter because the point-to-point logistics deter casual visitors.

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Morning start from Ribeiro Frio (the forest is most atmospheric with morning mist).
- **Crowd level**: Low to moderate. Much quieter than PR6, PR8, and PR9.
- **Best months**: Year-round. The laurel forest is evergreen and atmospheric in all seasons.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Wet and muddy**: The forest is perpetually damp. Expect mud, especially after rain. Waterproof boots recommended.
- **Narrow sections**: Some levada path sections are narrow with drops, but generally less exposed than PR9.
- **Length**: 11 km one-way requires reasonable fitness and time management.
- **Transport**: Make sure your return transport is arranged before starting.

### Water and Facilities

- **Ribeiro Frio**: Several cafes and restaurants, trout farm (worth a quick visit), toilet facilities.
- **On trail**: No facilities for 11 km.
- **Portela**: Restaurant with panoramic terrace at the end (Restaurante Portela a Vista). Toilets available.
- **Bring**: 1.5-2L of water, snacks, rain jacket, waterproof boots.

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.3/5 (676 reviews)
- **Listed as**: Moderate (some listings say Easy)
- **Reviews**: "Beautiful forest walk, very peaceful." "Mud, mud everywhere." "The end at Portela has an amazing view."

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

Often described as the "quiet alternative" to the more famous levada walks. Blog consensus: PR10 is the best levada for immersive forest atmosphere, but it lacks the dramatic waterfall payoff of PR6 or PR9. Reddit users consistently highlight two advantages: (1) it is accessible by public bus (no rental car needed) and (2) it is far less crowded than the famous trails. The main complaint is the logistics of the point-to-point route and the fact that the trail can be very muddy. With the current closure, many 2026 Reddit threads redirect people to PR11 + PR18 as alternatives in the same area.

## PR11 - Vereda dos Balcoes

**Ribeiro Frio to Balcoes Viewpoint**

### 2026 Status: OPEN

The easiest and shortest trail in this guide. A perfect "quick hit" viewpoint walk.

### Trail Details

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 1.5 km one-way (3 km round trip) |
| **Elevation gain** | Minimal (~60m) |
| **Highest point** | ~880m |
| **Lowest point** | ~860m (Ribeiro Frio) |
| **Time** | 30-45 minutes one-way (1-1.5 hours round trip) |
| **Difficulty** | Easy |
| **Trail type** | Out-and-back |
| **Trail surface** | Wide, flat, well-maintained levada path, some paved sections |
| **Tunnels** | None |

### Difficulty Explanation

This is as easy as Madeira hiking gets. The path is flat, wide, well-maintained, and follows the Levada da Serra do Faial. It is accessible for strollers and could potentially be navigated by wheelchair users on dry days (though not officially wheelchair-accessible). Suitable for all ages and fitness levels, including elderly visitors and young children.

### Transport Logistics

- **Loop**: No. Out-and-back.
- **Access**: Start at **Ribeiro Frio** on the ER 103. Same starting area as PR10.
- **By bus**: Bus 56 from Funchal to Ribeiro Frio (EUR 2.60).
- **By car**: Parking at Ribeiro Frio (free but limited).
- **Combine with**: PR10 (when open), or as a morning stop on the way to/from Santana.

### Key Highlights

- **Balcoes Viewpoint**: One of Madeira's most iconic viewpoints. A metal balcony jutting out from the mountain, offering panoramic views of the Ribeira da Metade valley and the central peaks (Pico do Arieiro, Pico das Torres, Pico Ruivo) on clear days.
- **Bird watching**: The Balcoes is one of the best spots on Madeira for seeing the endemic **Madeiran chaffinch** (Fringilla coelebs madeirensis). The birds are remarkably tame and will often approach hikers.
- **Laurissilva forest**: A short but immersive walk through beautiful laurel forest.
- **Faja da Nogueira**: The viewpoint overlooks a hydroelectric power plant in the valley below -- an interesting contrast of nature and engineering.

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Early morning for clearest views (clouds often build over the central peaks by midday).
- **Crowd level**: Moderate to high. Being short and easy, it attracts tour buses and casual visitors. The viewpoint platform can get crowded.
- **Pro tip**: Visit early (before 9:00 AM) or late afternoon for the best chance of a clear view and fewer people.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Minimal danger**. This is the safest trail in this guide.
- **Viewpoint railing**: The Balcoes platform has railings, but supervise children.
- **Slippery when wet**: Standard caution.

### Water and Facilities

- **Ribeiro Frio**: Cafes, restaurants, trout farm, toilets. Well-served starting point.
- **On trail**: No facilities.
- **Bring**: Water (0.5L is sufficient), camera.

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.3/5 (2,506 reviews)
- **Listed as**: Easy
- **Reviews**: "Best quick viewpoint on Madeira." "The chaffinches eat from your hand." "Can be crowded with tour groups at the viewpoint."

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

Everyone recommends PR11 as a "freebie" -- something you do in 1-1.5 hours on the way to or from something else. It is rarely anyone's primary destination for a day. Blog consensus: combine with PR10 (walk to Balcoes first, then start PR10 from Ribeiro Frio) or visit on the way to Santana. Reddit users love the endemic chaffinches and the viewpoint but warn that tour bus groups can overwhelm the small platform. Multiple threads note that it is the best quick hike if you have limited time or non-hiking travel companions.

## PR13 - Vereda do Fanal

**Assobiadores (Paul da Serra) to Fanal Forestry Post**

### 2026 Status: OPEN

A longer, more remote trail through one of Madeira's most atmospheric landscapes.

### Trail Details

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 10.8 km one-way (point-to-point) or out-and-back |
| **Elevation gain** | ~500m descent (Assobiadores to Fanal) |
| **Highest point** | ~1,400m (Paul da Serra plateau) |
| **Lowest point** | ~1,070m (Fanal) |
| **Time** | 4-5 hours one-way |
| **Difficulty** | Moderate to Hard |
| **Trail type** | Point-to-point (or out-and-back if returning to start) |
| **Trail surface** | Forest trails, dirt paths, some muddy sections, uneven ground |
| **Tunnels** | None |

### Difficulty Explanation

The trail is longer than it looks on paper because the terrain is uneven and the path can be muddy and poorly defined in sections. The descent from Paul da Serra into the Fanal valley involves sustained downhill on loose earth that can be slippery. Navigating the ancient Laurissilva forest section requires attention to path markers. The return (if walking back to Assobiadores) adds a significant uphill component. Some AllTrails users rate the full route as hard, taking up to 7-8 hours.

### Transport Logistics

- **Point-to-point**: Starts at Assobiadores on the Paul da Serra plateau (ER 110) and ends at Fanal Forestry Post.
- **Loop option**: None. Most hikers either arrange transport at both ends or walk out-and-back to Fanal from the plateau.
- **Access to Fanal directly**: You can drive to the Fanal Forestry Post via a narrow forest road from Ribeira da Janela. This gives direct access to the famous ancient trees without hiking the full PR13 (this is what most photographers do).
- **No public bus** to either end. Rental car essential.
- **Many visitors** drive directly to Fanal for the ancient trees and skip the full PR13 trail entirely. This is a valid strategy if you want the atmosphere without the 10+ km hike.

### Key Highlights

- **Ancient Til (Stinkwood) trees**: The Fanal forestry station sits in an ancient volcanic crater surrounded by **600-year-old Ocotea foetens trees**, twisted into bizarre, gnarled shapes by centuries of wind and weather. These are some of the oldest trees on Madeira and the most photographed natural feature outside the peaks.
- **Fog and mist**: Fanal is frequently shrouded in fog, which transforms the ancient trees into an eerie, otherworldly landscape. Many photographers specifically visit on foggy days -- the twisted trees in mist are Madeira's most iconic image.
- **Fio viewpoint**: Along the trail, offering dramatic views over Ribeira Funda valley and the north coast.
- **Cable installation (Sitio do Fio)**: Historical remnants of a cable system used to transport wood and shrubs from Fanal to the valleys below.
- **Solitude**: Far fewer hikers than PR6, PR8, or PR9.

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Early morning or any time fog is forecast. Paradoxically, "bad weather" (fog/mist) makes Fanal MORE impressive, not less.
- **Crowd level**: Low. This is one of the quieter trails in this guide. The Fanal forestry area itself sees moderate foot traffic from photographers and tourists who drive directly there.
- **Best months**: October-March for fog (which is the desired condition). Summer days can be clear and sunny, which is pretty but lacks the Fanal magic.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Fog navigation**: In heavy fog, the trail can be difficult to follow. GPS and downloaded offline maps (AllTrails, Komoot) are strongly recommended.
- **Muddy terrain**: The forest floor is often waterlogged. Waterproof boots essential.
- **Isolation**: This is a remote trail. You are unlikely to encounter other hikers for long stretches. Ensure someone knows your plans.
- **Paul da Serra fog**: The plateau road can be extremely foggy. Drive with extreme caution.
- **Cattle**: Free-ranging cattle graze near Fanal. They are generally docile but give them space.

### Water and Facilities

- **Assobiadores**: No facilities at the trailhead.
- **Fanal Forestry Post**: Basic area, no cafe or shops. There may be seasonal food vendors on busy days.
- **On trail**: No facilities.
- **Bring**: 2L+ of water, lunch, rain gear (fog = moisture), warm layers, GPS/offline map.

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.4/5 (441 reviews for main PR13; 4.5/5 with 1,502 reviews for the Fanal-Fio viewpoint variant)
- **Listed as**: Moderate to Hard (depending on route variant)
- **Reviews**: "The ancient trees in fog are unforgettable." "Like walking into a fairy tale." "Trail markings could be better." "Muddy but magical."

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

Fanal divides opinions based on weather. Bloggers who visited in fog rave about it ("the most otherworldly place in Europe"). Those who visited on a clear, sunny day often find it "nice but underwhelming." Reddit consensus: check the weather forecast and go when fog is predicted for the plateau. The full PR13 trail is rarely recommended by bloggers compared to simply driving to Fanal and walking around the ancient trees (30-60 minutes). The full trail is for serious hikers who want a quieter, longer day.

## PR17 - Caminho do Pinaculo e Folhadal

**Lombo do Mouro / Encumeada to Bica da Cana**

### 2026 Status: PARTIALLY OPEN (Encumeada to Bica da Cana Section)

The full PR17 route has been affected by weather damage and the 2024 fires. As of early 2026, the trail is **only passable between Encumeada and Bica da Cana**. Some sections toward Lombo do Mouro remain closed. The full trail may reopen by April 2026. Verify on the SIMplifica portal.

### Trail Details (Full Route)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 15 km (full point-to-point) |
| **Elevation gain** | ~520m total ascent |
| **Highest point** | 1,490m |
| **Lowest point** | 970m (Encumeada) |
| **Time** | 6-7 hours |
| **Difficulty** | Hard |
| **Trail type** | Point-to-point |
| **Trail surface** | Levada path, stone-paved sections, rock-cut tunnels, forest floor |
| **Tunnels** | 5 tunnels (2 very long: ~500m and ~1km) |

### Difficulty Explanation

PR17 is one of Madeira's most challenging classified trails. The difficulty comes from the combination of: (1) long distance (15 km one-way), (2) significant elevation changes, (3) five tunnels including two exceptionally long ones (one approximately 500m, another approximately 1 km) that are pitch-dark, wet, and require sustained bent-over walking in places, and (4) exposed levada sections. This is not a trail for beginners. The tunnels alone separate this from easier levada walks -- walking 1 km through pitch darkness in ankle-deep water while ducking under low ceilings is a genuine adventure (or ordeal, depending on your personality).

### Transport Logistics

- **Point-to-point**: Starts at Lombo do Mouro (near Encumeada pass) and ends at Bica da Cana.
- **By car**: You need to arrange two cars or a taxi. Most hikers leave a car at Bica da Cana and taxi to the start at Encumeada, or vice versa.
- **Encumeada pass**: Accessible from Funchal via ER 228 (about 40 minutes). Has a restaurant and parking.
- **Bica da Cana**: On the Paul da Serra plateau (ER 110). About 15 minutes drive from Rabacal car park.
- **No public bus** to either end.

### Key Highlights

- **Tunnel adventure**: The two long tunnels (500m and 1km) are extraordinary -- walking through pitch-black, hand-carved rock passages with water flowing at your feet. This is the most "spelunking-like" experience on any Madeira PR trail.
- **Cascata do Folhadal**: The Folhadal waterfall, accessible from within the levada system, is a hidden gem.
- **Pinaculo viewpoint**: Panoramic view over the Ribeira Brava valley with Pico Ruivo and Pico do Arieiro as a backdrop.
- **Levada engineering**: Following both the Levada da Serra and Levada do Norte -- two of Madeira's great historical water channels.
- **Solitude**: Far fewer hikers than the marquee trails.
- **Cascading waterfalls**: Multiple smaller waterfalls appear throughout the route, especially in the Folhadal area.

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Dry weather is preferred for this trail (the tunnels are wet enough without rain). Morning start essential given the length.
- **Crowd level**: Low. This is one of the least-visited trails in this guide due to its difficulty and length.
- **Best months**: May-October for driest conditions. The tunnels are wet year-round regardless.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Long tunnels**: The ~1km tunnel is the most challenging tunnel passage on any Madeira PR trail. Pitch-dark, wet floor (standing water, sometimes ankle-deep), low ceiling requiring crouching for extended periods. A proper headlamp (not just a phone) is absolutely essential. Claustrophobic hikers should skip this trail.
- **Waterproof gear**: Your feet WILL get wet. Waterproof boots or trail shoes you do not mind soaking. Spare socks.
- **Length and remoteness**: 15 km in challenging terrain. This is a full-day commitment. Start early.
- **Route finding**: Some sections are less well-marked than the popular trails. Offline GPS map recommended.
- **Exposed levada sections**: Some cliff-side passages similar to PR9 but less maintained.

### Water and Facilities

- **Encumeada**: Restaurant (Restaurante Encumeada) and basic parking area.
- **On trail**: No facilities for the entire 15 km.
- **Bica da Cana**: No facilities at the endpoint.
- **Bring**: 2-3L of water, full lunch, headlamp (with spare batteries), waterproof boots, spare socks, rain jacket, warm layers, offline GPS map.

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.5/5 (218 reviews for main listing; 194 reviews for Encumeada-Bica da Cana variant)
- **Listed as**: Hard
- **Reviews**: "The tunnels are insane -- bring a good headlamp." "Most adventurous hike on Madeira." "Waterproof shoes are mandatory, not optional." "Stunning waterfalls and views, with almost no other hikers."

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

PR17 is the "adventure hiker's trail" -- consistently recommended by experienced hikers and consistently warned against for casual visitors. Blog consensus: if you want the most dramatic tunnel experience on Madeira, PR17 is superior to PR9 (longer tunnels, fewer people). Reddit threads praise it as "the hidden gem of Madeira hiking" and "the trail that makes you feel like a real explorer." Common warnings: do not attempt without a headlamp, do not wear trainers (your feet will be submerged), and do not underestimate the time required. Several Reddit posts note that the trail feels "abandoned" compared to the manicured popular trails, which is part of the appeal.

## PR18 - Levada do Rei

**Quebradas Water Treatment Plant (Sao Jorge) to Ribeiro Bonito**

### 2026 Status: OPEN

A peaceful, easy levada walk in the north of the island, far from the south coast tourist centres.

### Trail Details

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | 5.1 km one-way (10.2 km round trip) |
| **Elevation gain** | Minimal (~150m cumulative) |
| **Highest point** | ~550m |
| **Lowest point** | ~400m |
| **Time** | 3-4 hours round trip |
| **Difficulty** | Easy |
| **Trail type** | Out-and-back |
| **Trail surface** | Levada path, forest floor, some earth sections |
| **Tunnels** | 1 short tunnel (a few metres, no headlamp strictly required) |

### Difficulty Explanation

PR18 is one of the easiest levada walks on Madeira. The path is well-maintained, mostly flat, and clearly marked. There are no moments of genuine danger, no significant exposure, and the single tunnel is so short you can see daylight at both ends. The "moderate" rating sometimes seen on booking sites overestimates the difficulty. This is an easy, relaxed forest walk suitable for families, beginners, and those wanting a gentler experience.

### Transport Logistics

- **Loop**: No. Out-and-back.
- **Access**: Start at the **Quebradas Water Treatment Plant** in Sao Jorge, near Santana. About 45 minutes from Funchal via VE4 and ER 101.
- **Parking**: At the trailhead, with space for ~20 cars. Free.
- **No public bus** directly to the trailhead (nearest bus stop is in Sao Jorge village, about 1 km walk).
- **Combine with**: A visit to Santana (traditional A-frame houses), or with PR1.2 (Achada do Teixeira is a 30-minute drive from Sao Jorge).

### Key Highlights

- **Ribeiro Bonito ("Pretty Stream")**: The turnaround point is a pristine natural sanctuary where the levada meets a forest stream. Dense Laurissilva canopy, crystal-clear water, moss-covered rocks -- one of the most peaceful spots on Madeira.
- **Levada do Rei ("King's Levada")**: Named because it was traditionally the water channel that served the table of the King of Portugal. Walking along this historical channel is a journey through agricultural and natural history.
- **Agricultural landscapes**: The first section passes through traditional Sao Jorge farmland (banana, vine, sugarcane terraces) before entering the forest.
- **Vegetation tunnels**: Natural tunnels formed by overhanging vegetation (not rock tunnels). Atmospheric and beautiful.
- **Birdlife**: Rich birdlife in the Laurissilva forest section.

### Best Time and Crowds

- **Best time**: Any time. The forest is beautiful in all conditions.
- **Crowd level**: Low to moderate. Far less crowded than PR6, PR8, or PR9 because of its location in the north.
- **Best months**: Year-round. The north of Madeira is wetter, so expect some rain/mist regardless of season. This actually enhances the forest atmosphere.

### Dangers and Safety

- **Minimal danger**. This is one of the safest trails in this guide.
- **Slippery when wet**: The forest floor and levada path can be slick after rain. Good grip footwear recommended.
- **No exposure**: The path is never narrow or cliff-side in a dangerous way.

### Water and Facilities

- **Trailhead**: Quinta Levada do Rei (a nearby restaurant/cafe) is available for coffee, lunch, and toilet use before or after the hike. There may not be dedicated toilet facilities at the trailhead itself -- the restaurant lets you use theirs, especially if you make a purchase.
- **On trail**: No facilities.
- **Bring**: 1-1.5L of water, light snacks.

### AllTrails

- **Rating**: ~4.4/5 (1,361 reviews for main listing; 4.4/5 with 318 reviews for extended variant)
- **Listed as**: Easy to Moderate
- **Reviews**: "So peaceful and beautiful." "The endpoint at Ribeiro Bonito is worth every step." "Easy walk, great for families." "Less crowded than the famous levadas."

### Blog and Reddit Consensus

PR18 is the "hidden gem" levada -- the one recommended by people who have done all the famous trails and want something quieter. Blog consensus: not as dramatic as PR6 or PR9, but more peaceful and intimate. The endpoint at Ribeiro Bonito is universally praised as magical. Reddit users recommend it for people who have already done the big trails and want something off the beaten path, or for those with limited fitness who still want a genuine Madeira levada experience. Common advice: combine with a visit to Santana and/or PR1.2 for a full day on the north side.

| Trail | AllTrails Rating | Number of Reviews | AllTrails Difficulty | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PR1** | ~4.7/5 | 3,700-4,000+ | Hard | Currently listed as [CLOSED]. Reviews from pre-2024. |
| **PR1.2** | ~4.6/5 | 4,077 | Moderate | Highest review count. Currently the only summit route. |
| **PR6** | ~4.5/5 | 3,225+ | Moderate | Multiple listing variants exist. |
| **PR6.1** | ~4.4/5 | 543 | Easy | Often not listed separately (combined with PR6). |
| **PR8** | **~4.7/5** | **6,999+** | Moderate | **Highest-rated trail.** Most reviews of any Madeira trail. |
| **PR9** | ~4.6/5 | 4,214+ | Moderate | AllTrails elevation data is wildly inaccurate (GPS tunnel errors). |
| **PR10** | ~4.3/5 | 676 | Easy-Moderate | Currently closed. |
| **PR11** | ~4.3/5 | 2,506 | Easy | Lowest rating in this list but still very good. |
| **PR13** | ~4.4/5 | 441-1,502 | Moderate-Hard | Rating varies by route variant listed. |
| **PR17** | ~4.5/5 | 218 | Hard | Fewest reviews -- reflects low foot traffic. |
| **PR18** | ~4.4/5 | 1,361 | Easy-Moderate | Underrated gem. |

### Key Observations

- **PR8 dominates** AllTrails with both the highest rating (4.7) and most reviews (7,000+).
- **PR1 ties at 4.7** but has been closed since 2024, so recent reviews are absent.
- **All trails in this guide rate 4.3 or higher** -- there are no bad hikes on this list.
- **AllTrails elevation data is unreliable** for Madeira levada trails, especially those with tunnels. GPS signals bounce in tunnels and report phantom elevation changes. The actual trails are much flatter than AllTrails suggests.
- **Review counts correlate with popularity**, not quality. PR17 (218 reviews) is not worse than PR8 (7,000 reviews) -- it is simply less visited.

## Trail Combination Suggestions

### Same-Day Hike Pairings

These combinations are tested and feasible for reasonably fit hikers within a single day:

#### 1. PR6 + PR6.1 (The Rabacal Double) -- CLASSIC COMBINATION

- **Total time**: 4-5 hours including shuttle
- **Logistics**: Same starting point (Rabacal). Do PR6.1 first (Risco waterfall, 30-40 min return), then PR6 (25 Fontes, 2.5-3.5 hours return).
- **Why**: These trails share a trailhead and complement each other perfectly. PR6.1 is the appetizer (easy, big waterfall), PR6 is the main course (longer, tunnel, pool).
- **Total distance**: ~12-14 km including the shuttle road
- **Booking**: You need separate SIMplifica bookings for PR6 and PR6.1 (EUR 4.50 each).

#### 2. PR11 + PR18 (North Coast Easy Day)

- **Total time**: 4-5 hours of hiking
- **Logistics**: Start with PR11 at Ribeiro Frio (1-1.5 hours), drive 30 minutes to Sao Jorge, do PR18 (3-4 hours).
- **Why**: Both are easy, both are on the north side, and they offer contrasting experiences (mountain viewpoint vs. forest levada).
- **Total distance**: ~13 km combined
- **Ideal for**: Families, beginners, or a relaxed hiking day.

#### 3. PR1.2 + PR18 (Summit and Levada)

- **Total time**: 5-6 hours of hiking + driving
- **Logistics**: Start with PR1.2 at Achada do Teixeira for sunrise/early morning (2-3 hours return), drive 30 minutes to Sao Jorge for PR18 (3-4 hours).
- **Why**: You get Madeira's highest summit AND a peaceful levada walk in one day. Very different experiences.
- **Total distance**: ~16 km combined

#### 4. PR8 + PR11 (Coast and Forest)

- **Total time**: 5-6 hours of hiking + 45 min drive between
- **Logistics**: Start PR8 at sunrise (Baia d'Abra, 2.5-3.5 hours), drive to Ribeiro Frio for PR11 (1-1.5 hours). Finish by early afternoon.
- **Why**: Maximum contrast -- volcanic coastal desert vs. lush mountain forest. Two entirely different Madeiras in one day.
- **Total distance**: ~10 km combined

#### 5. PR6 + PR6.1 + PR11 (The Triple Play)

- **Total time**: 6-7 hours of hiking + 1+ hour driving
- **Logistics**: Morning at Rabacal (PR6.1 + PR6, 4-5 hours total), drive east to Ribeiro Frio (~1 hour), finish with PR11 (1 hour).
- **Why**: Three trails, three different experiences, all in one day. Ambitious but doable with an early start.
- **Total distance**: ~15-17 km combined
- **Note**: This is a long day. Book the Rabacal trails for the earliest shuttle or walk the road down before shuttle starts.

#### 6. PR1.2 + PR11 (Quick Summit + Quick Viewpoint)

- **Total time**: 3-4 hours of hiking + 30 min drive
- **Logistics**: PR1.2 at Achada do Teixeira (2-3 hours return), drive to Ribeiro Frio for PR11 (1-1.5 hours).
- **Why**: Two of Madeira's best viewpoints in a half day, leaving the afternoon free.
- **Total distance**: ~8.5 km combined
- **Ideal for**: A day when you want hiking + afternoon beach/Funchal time.

### Combinations to AVOID

- **PR9 + anything**: At 17.4 km round trip taking 5-7 hours, PR9 is a full-day commitment. Do not try to add another trail.
- **PR17 + anything**: At 15 km and 6-7 hours, this is also a full-day trail.
- **PR13 (full route) + anything**: 10.8 km through remote terrain is a full day.
- **PR1 + PR1.2**: When PR1 reopens, the full traverse + PR1.2 approach will be a massive day (20+ km total). Possible for very fit hikers but extremely ambitious.

### Weekly Itinerary Suggestion (5 Hiking Days)

| Day | Trail(s) | Focus | Hours |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 1 | **PR8** | Coastal volcanic drama | 3-4 hours |
| Day 2 | **PR6 + PR6.1** | Rabacal waterfalls + tunnel | 4-5 hours |
| Day 3 | **PR9** | Caldeirao Verde levada + tunnels | 5-7 hours |
| Day 4 | **PR1.2 + PR18** | Summit + north coast levada | 5-6 hours |
| Day 5 | **PR13** (drive to Fanal) + **PR11** | Ancient trees + Balcoes viewpoint | 3-4 hours |

This sequence provides excellent variety: coastal, forest, mountain, waterfall, and ancient trees. It also alternates hard days (Day 3) with easier ones (Day 5).

## General Safety and Packing Notes

### Essential Gear for Every Hike

- **Waterproof hiking boots or trail shoes**: Not trainers. Levada paths are wet, muddy, and slippery. Tunnels have standing water.
- **Headlamp**: Essential for PR6, PR9, PR17. Useful for PR1, PR10. Bring one even if you do not plan to enter tunnels.
- **Rain jacket/windproof layer**: Weather changes rapidly at altitude. Even on a sunny Funchal morning, the mountains can be cold, wet, and windy.
- **Water**: Minimum 1.5L per person for most trails. 2-3L for longer trails (PR9, PR13, PR17).
- **Sun protection**: Hat, sunscreen, sunglasses. Especially critical for PR8 (no shade).
- **Warm layer**: Temperatures above 1,000m are significantly cooler than Funchal. PR1/PR1.2 at 1,800m can be 10-15C cooler.
- **Offline maps**: Download your trail on AllTrails, Komoot, or similar before setting out. Mobile signal is unreliable on most mountain trails.
- **Phone in waterproof case**: Spray near waterfalls, rain, and tunnel drips can damage phones.
- **Spare socks**: For any trail with tunnels. Your feet WILL get wet.

### Weather Considerations

- **Madeira has microclimates**: Funchal can be sunny while the mountains are in cloud. Check webcams and forecasts for specific areas.
- **Morning is best**: Clouds typically build over the interior mountains from late morning. Start early for the best views.
- **North vs south**: The north coast (PR18, Santana area) is wetter than the south. The Paul da Serra plateau (PR6, PR13) is frequently foggy.
- **Winter hiking**: Trails are open year-round but winter (November-February) brings more rain, shorter days, and occasional closures from storm damage.

### Emergency Information

- **Emergency number**: 112 (European emergency number)
- **Mountain rescue**: Policia de Seguranca Publica (PSP) coordinates mountain rescue on Madeira.
- **No mobile signal**: Many trail sections have no signal. Tell someone your plans.
- **Trail condition updates**: Check the IFCN website (ifcn.madeira.gov.pt) and the SIMplifica portal for real-time closures.

### Getting Around

- **Rental car strongly recommended**: Public buses do not serve most trailheads. PR10 (bus 56 to Ribeiro Frio) and PR11 are the exceptions.
- **Driving tips**: Mountain roads are narrow, steep, and winding. Fog is common on the ER 110 (Paul da Serra) and ER 218 (Achada do Teixeira). Drive carefully.
- **Taxi/transfer services**: Widely available from Funchal for trailhead drop-offs. Useful for point-to-point trails (PR1, PR10, PR17).
- **Guided tours**: Many operators in Funchal offer guided hikes with transport included. Useful if you do not want to drive or navigate logistics.

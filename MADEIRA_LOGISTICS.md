# Madeira March 2026 -- Practical Logistics Guide

Researched February 2026. Sources cited throughout.

---

## 1. Car Rental

### Do You Need a Car?

**Yes, strongly recommended.** About 50% of the best hikes and viewpoints are unreachable by public transport, and another 30% are technically reachable but highly impractical by bus. Popular hikes like 25 Fontes (PR6) and Fanal have no bus service. The only realistic car-free hiking is PR10 (Ribeiro Frio to Portela, accessible by bus) and PR8 (Sao Lourenco, reachable by bus to Canical).

March is off-season, so rental prices are at their lowest -- as low as **EUR 10-15/day** for a manual, EUR 15-25/day for automatic.

### Best Companies

| Company | Type | Rating | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| **Insular Car** | Local | 10.0/10 | Highest-rated on Madeira |
| **AutoRentaCar** | Local | High | No deposit/excess option, transparent pricing, personal service |
| **Rodavante** | Local | 8.5/10 | Good value, some mixed reviews |
| **7M Rent a Car** | Local | Good | Online booking, pay at pickup |
| **Madeira Rent** | Local | Good | Accepts debit cards and cash, free hotel delivery |
| **SIXT** | International | Standard | Reliable but pricier |

**Booking platforms:** DiscoverCars, KAYAK, momondo all aggregate. Local companies (AutoRentaCar, Insular) are often cheaper and more flexible than international chains.

### Automatic vs Manual

- **Manual is significantly cheaper** (EUR 5-10/day less)
- **Automatic strongly recommended** -- Madeira roads are steep, narrow, with tight hairpins and constant hill starts
- March (off-season) has better automatic availability than summer, but **book 3-6 weeks ahead** to guarantee one
- Automatic inventory is limited island-wide

### Airport vs Funchal Pickup

- **Airport (FNC):** Convenient on arrival, all major companies have desks. Slightly more expensive due to airport surcharge
- **Funchal city:** Can save EUR 15-25 over a week-long rental. Many local companies offer free hotel delivery
- **Recommendation:** Unless your accommodation is walking distance from a Funchal rental office, airport pickup saves hassle

### Insurance Tips

- **CDW (Collision Damage Waiver)** is always included in the base price in Portugal -- but with a high excess (EUR 1,000-2,500)
- **SCDW (Super CDW)** reduces or eliminates the excess -- costs EUR 15-30/day at the counter
- **Best strategy:** Either (a) buy SCDW directly from the rental company to zero-excess, or (b) use a third-party excess insurance (RentalCover, iCarhire) for ~EUR 5-8/day purchased online before arrival
- **Critical:** Take photos/video of the entire car at pickup. The rental company should mark existing damage on a diagram -- photograph that too
- SCDW is only available to drivers aged 25-70
- Most local companies (AutoRentaCar, Madeira Rent) accept debit cards; international chains usually require credit cards

### Driving Notes

- Roads are excellent (well-paved highways and mountain roads)
- Mountain roads have tight switchbacks, steep grades, one-lane sections with passing bays
- Tunnels everywhere -- some are one-lane alternating traffic
- Fuel: ~EUR 1.67/liter for unleaded 95 as of late 2025

## 2. Parking at Trailheads

### Pico do Areeiro (PR1)

| Lot | Cost | Capacity | Distance to Summit |
|-----|------|----------|-------------------|
| **P1 (Upper)** | EUR 4/hour, EUR 20/24h max | ~70 spaces | 1-2 min walk |
| **P2 (Lower)** | EUR 2/hour, EUR 5/24h max | ~300 spaces | 15 min uphill walk |

- **Payment:** Card only. First 15 minutes free (for drop-offs)
- **Fills up:** P1 fills during sunrise visits. By 10am-3pm, chaotic due to tour buses. P2 almost always has spaces
- **Tip:** If hiking, use P2 (much cheaper at EUR 5/day vs EUR 20/day). If just visiting the viewpoint, P1 for a quick stop

### Achada do Teixeira (PR1.2 to Pico Ruivo)

- **Cost:** FREE parking
- **Capacity:** Ample on weekdays, fills on weekends/holidays
- **Facilities:** Restrooms, restaurant (Abrigo da Heidi)
- **Open 24 hours**
- **Note:** The PR1.2 trail from here to Pico Ruivo is OPEN (5.6 km round trip, 1.5-2 hours)

### Rabaçal (PR6 - 25 Fontes / PR6.1 - Risco)

- **Upper parking lot** (at road level): EUR 2/hour -- this is where you park and either walk or take shuttle down
- **Shuttle bus** to trailhead: EUR 5 one-way / EUR 8 return (cash only). Operates 10am-6pm. Saves 20-25 min walk (downhill going, uphill returning)
- **Shuttle is NOT required** -- you can walk the paved road down to the trailhead (and many prefer to start before 10am to beat crowds, when shuttle isn't running yet)
- **Tip:** If starting early (before 10am), walk down. Take shuttle back up when tired after the hike

### Queimadas Forest Park (PR9 - Caldeirao Verde)

- **Cost:** EUR 2/hour, EUR 10/day cap
- **Capacity:** Large lot, but fills by late morning in summer
- **Access road:** Last 3 km is VERY narrow single-lane road with passing bays, climbing from 500m to 880m. Cars go both directions. Passing bays sometimes blocked by parked cars
- **Tip:** Arrive by 8:30-9:00am. The road alone is a reason to get there early before opposing traffic builds

### PR8 - Ponta de Sao Lourenco

- **Capacity:** ~60 spaces in two small lots at the end of ER109 road
- **Cost:** Free (as of last reports, but may change under 2026 system)
- **Fills up:** Half full by 8:00am in summer (July). In March, less pressure but still arrive early on weekends
- **Overflow:** People park along ER109 roadside, adding 1-2 km walk to trailhead
- **Tip:** Arrive by 8:30am to guarantee a spot. March should be easier than summer

### Ribeiro Frio (PR10 - Levada do Furado / PR11 - Balcoes)

- **Capacity:** Only ~10 parking spaces
- **Cost:** Free
- **Extremely limited** -- this is a popular tourist stop (trout hatchery, restaurant)
- **Alternative:** Bus route #56 from Funchal reaches Ribeiro Frio. This is one trail where bus access actually works well
- **Tip:** Arrive very early or consider the bus

## 5. Trail Booking System (SIMplifica)

### CRITICAL: This is NEW for 2026 and MANDATORY

As of January 1, 2026, ALL 42 classified PR hiking trails in Madeira require:
1. Online reservation with specific time slot
2. Payment of hiking fee
3. Digital ticket/QR code carried on the trail

### Step-by-Step Booking Process

**URL:** [https://simplifica.madeira.gov.pt](https://simplifica.madeira.gov.pt)

1. **Go to** simplifica.madeira.gov.pt
2. **Create an account** (email, name, country of origin)
3. **Find the service:** "Pagamento de Taxas para Percursos Pedestres Classificados"
4. **Select your trail** (e.g., PR6, PR8, PR9)
5. **Choose your date**
6. **Pick a 30-minute time slot** (you must START the hike within your chosen slot)
7. **Enter details** for all hikers (including children, who are free but must be registered)
8. **Pay online** (minimum EUR 4.50/person/trail)
9. **Download your QR code/confirmation** -- save to phone gallery for offline access (signal may be unavailable at trailheads)

### Fee Structure (2026)

| Type | General Public | Tour Operators |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Single trail** | EUR 4.50 | EUR 3.00 |
| **PR1 (April 2026+)** | EUR 10.50 | EUR 7.00 |
| **1-day pass** (2+ trails) | EUR 9.00 | EUR 6.00 |
| **3-day pass** (consecutive) | EUR 22.50 | EUR 15.00 |
| **7-day pass** (consecutive) | EUR 52.50 | EUR 35.00 |

**Multi-day pass math:**
- 1-day pass saves money with 3+ trails in one day
- 3-day pass saves money with 6+ trails in 3 days
- 7-day pass saves money with 12+ trails in 7 days
- **PR1 is EXCLUDED from all multi-day passes** -- always a separate booking

### Booking Timing

- **Same-day booking** is possible if slots remain
- **Recommended:** Book 1-3 days ahead for flexibility
- **Popular trails (PR6, PR8)** may sell out during peak hours on weekends
- March is off-season, so same-day should work most days -- but don't count on it for sunrise slots

### Cancellation Policy

- Refunds guaranteed when IFCN officially closes a trail (weather/safety/maintenance)
- Personal cancellations: follow policies on your confirmation
- Cancel at least 24 hours in advance for a full refund

### Enforcement

- Nature Wardens check QR codes at trail entrances, especially on high-demand trails (PR1, PR6, PR8)
- Screenshot is sufficient if you have no signal
- **Exemptions:** Madeira residents (free but must still register), children under 12 (free but must register), 60%+ disability (free but must register)

### What Happens If You Don't Book?

You may be turned away at the trailhead by Nature Wardens, or fined. Enforcement is new and evolving, but the system is mandatory.

## 6. March Weather Specifics

### Temperature by Altitude

| Location | Altitude | Avg High | Avg Low | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Funchal (south coast)** | Sea level | 18-22C (64-72F) | 14-16C (57-61F) | Mildest, driest |
| **North coast** (Sao Vicente, Santana) | Sea level | 16-19C (61-66F) | 12-14C (54-57F) | Wetter, cloudier |
| **Levada altitude** | 600-1000m | 12-16C (54-61F) | 8-12C (46-54F) | In shade/tunnels, feels colder |
| **Pico do Areeiro** | 1818m | 6-10C (43-50F) | 2-5C (36-41F) | Wind chill significant. Can approach freezing |
| **Pico Ruivo** | 1862m | 5-9C (41-48F) | 1-4C (34-39F) | Highest point on island |

**Rule of thumb:** Temperature drops ~6-7C per 1,000m of altitude gain.

### Rainfall

- **South coast (Funchal):** Relatively low rainfall. Brief showers followed by sun is the typical pattern -- rarely all-day rain
- **North coast:** Significantly wetter. More persistent cloud and drizzle
- **Mountains:** Most rain falls here. Cloud can roll in fast at 1500m+. Mountain weather is unpredictable
- **Laurissilva forest (levadas):** Perpetually humid/misty regardless of coastal weather. Expect wet conditions in the forest even on "sunny" days
- **March total rainfall:** Moderate (one of the wetter months, but not the worst -- that's November-January)

### Wind

- Exposed ridges (Areeiro, Ruivo, Sao Lourenco) can have very strong wind
- Sao Lourenco in particular is known for wind -- March can be gusty
- Wind chill at altitude is the real danger -- 8C with 40 km/h wind feels much colder

### Sea Temperature

~18C (64F) -- cool for swimming but fine for coastal walks.

### Key Weather Insight

Madeira has extreme microclimates. It can be sunny in Funchal, raining in Santana, foggy at Areeiro, and clear at Sao Lourenco -- all simultaneously. Check webcams before driving to mountain hikes. The south coast is almost always the most pleasant.

## 7. Packing List for March Hiking

### Footwear (Most Important)

- **Waterproof hiking boots/shoes** (Gore-Tex or similar) -- NON-NEGOTIABLE. Levada paths are wet, muddy, and slippery year-round
- **Grip matters** -- volcanic rock gets slick when wet. Good tread essential
- **Extra pair of dry socks** in daypack
- **Moisture-wicking socks** (merino wool ideal)

### Layering System

- **Base layer:** Moisture-wicking t-shirt or long-sleeve
- **Mid layer:** Fleece or lightweight insulating jacket (essential above 1000m)
- **Outer layer:** **Waterproof rain jacket** -- the single most important garment. Lightweight, packable. You WILL need it in the laurissilva even if Funchal is sunny
- **Rain pants** (optional but recommended for longer hikes, especially PR9)
- For Pico Areeiro/Ruivo: bring a **warm hat and gloves** in March. It can be near-freezing with wind chill

### Essential Gear

- **Headlamp** (CRITICAL for tunnel levadas) -- many levadas pass through tunnels that are pitch black, uneven, with water dripping. Headlamp > flashlight because hands-free. Bring spare batteries
- **Small daypack** (20-30L) with rain cover
- **Water** (1-2 liters minimum per hike)
- **Sunscreen + sunglasses** -- UV is strong even in March, especially at altitude or Sao Lourenco
- **Hat** (sun hat for Sao Lourenco, warm hat for mountains)
- **Trekking poles** (highly recommended for steep descents and slippery paths)
- **Offline maps downloaded** (Google Maps offline area, or AllTrails/Maps.me/Organic Maps)

### Nice to Have

- Waterproof phone case or dry bag (for tunnel drips)
- First aid kit (basics: blister plasters, antiseptic, bandage)
- Snacks/lunch (limited food options at most trailheads)
- Buff/neck gaiter (versatile for wind, cold, sun)
- Quick-dry hiking pants (NOT jeans -- they stay wet forever)
- Small towel (for wiping gear after wet tunnels)

### For Funchal / Non-Hiking Days

- Light jacket/sweater for evenings
- Comfortable walking shoes for cobblestone streets
- Smart casual for nicer restaurants (Funchal is not ultra-casual)

## 8. Airport Logistics (FNC - Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport)

### Arriving

- Small, single-terminal airport
- Car rental desks are in the arrivals hall
- ATMs and currency exchange available
- Free WiFi throughout
- **Aerobus** to Funchal: EUR 5-8, runs per flight schedule, 30-45 min with hotel stops
- **Taxi** to Funchal: EUR 25-35, 20-25 min
- **Pre-booked transfer** (Welcome Pickups etc.): ~EUR 25-30

### Departing

- **Arrive 2 hours before** Schengen flights, 2.5-3 hours for international
- Security is usually quick (small airport), but can back up during peak season
- Online check-in recommended to skip check-in queues
- **Duty-free** is airside (after security) -- good selection of:
  - **Madeira wine** (Blandy's, Henriques & Henriques) -- significantly cheaper duty-free
  - Portuguese wines, ginjinha, poncha
  - Local products, perfumes

### Known Issue: Wind Diversions

FNC airport is notoriously affected by crosswinds. Flights are occasionally diverted to Porto Santo or mainland Portugal, or delayed/cancelled. This is more common in winter/spring. Nothing you can do about it -- just be aware and consider travel insurance that covers diversions.

## 9. Phone & Internet

### eSIM Options (Recommended)

| Provider | Data | Duration | Price | Notes |
|----------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Airalo** | 1 GB | 7 days | ~EUR 4.50 | Cheapest entry |
| **Airalo** | 3 GB | 30 days | ~EUR 8 | Good for a week trip |
| **Saily** | Various | Various | From EUR 4 | By the NordVPN team |
| **Holafly** | Unlimited | 5-15 days | EUR 19-49 | No data anxiety |
| **Yoho Mobile** | 50 GB | 30 days | ~EUR 37 | Best value for heavy use |

**Setup:** Purchase and install eSIM before departure. Activate on arrival. Most modern phones support eSIM (check your phone model).

**Alternative:** Buy a physical Vodafone or MEO SIM at FNC airport or Funchal phone shops.

### Coverage on Trails

- **Funchal and coastal towns:** Excellent 4G/5G coverage
- **Levada hikes (forest):** Intermittent to no signal. Deep valleys and laurissilva forest block signal
- **Mountain summits (Areeiro, Ruivo):** Often good coverage (exposed, high elevation)
- **PR8 Sao Lourenco:** Generally good (exposed coastal terrain)
- **Tunnels:** Zero signal

### Critical: Download Offline Maps

**Non-negotiable for hiking.** Before leaving your accommodation each day:

1. **Google Maps:** Download the entire Madeira Island offline area
2. **AllTrails:** Download specific trail maps for offline use
3. **Organic Maps / Maps.me:** Full offline map with hiking trails
4. GPS works without cell signal -- your phone's GPS chip uses satellites, not cell towers

## 10. Emergency Contacts

### Critical Numbers

| Service | Number | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **European Emergency** | **112** | Free from any phone. Mountain rescue, ambulance, police, fire |
| **Hospital Dr. Nelio Mendonca** | 291 705 600 | Main hospital in Funchal. Av. Luis de Camoes 57, 9004-514 Funchal. 24/7 ER |
| **Red Cross** | 291 741 115 | |
| **Poison Centre (CIAV)** | 808 250 143 | |
| **Maritime Police** | 291 213 112 | |
| **PSP Police (Funchal)** | 291 208 400 | |

### Mountain Rescue Procedure

1. **Call 112** -- request mountain rescue (Protecao Civil / SEMER)
2. Give your **GPS coordinates** (this is why offline maps matter -- your phone can still get GPS even without signal)
3. Stay put unless in immediate danger
4. SEMER (Regional Medical Emergency Service) includes EMIR (Rapid Intervention Medical Team), equipped for mountain, maritime, and air rescue

### Trail Safety Notes

- **Helicopter rescue fees:** If you need rescue on an UNOFFICIAL or CLOSED trail, the government charges for helicopter rescue. Stick to classified, open PR trails
- **EHIC/GHIC card:** EU/UK citizens should carry European Health Insurance Card for subsidized emergency care
- **Travel insurance:** STRONGLY recommended, especially one that covers mountain rescue/helicopter evacuation

### Nearest Pharmacies

Pharmacies in Funchal are well-stocked and pharmacists speak English. Look for the green cross sign. Many common medications are available without prescription that would require one elsewhere.

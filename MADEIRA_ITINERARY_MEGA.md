5 nights, 4 full days.

---

## Before You Go: 2026 Rules of the Game

### PR1 (Areeiro → Ruivo) is CLOSED
The full PR1 ridge trail is closed until April 2026 due to August 2024 wildfire damage. You can only walk the first 1.2 km to Miradouro da Pedra Rija from Areeiro (still worth it for the viewpoint). **To reach Pico Ruivo summit, use PR1.2 from Achada do Teixeira** — 5.6 km round trip, open now.

### Funchal-Monte Cable Car is CLOSED
Closed Jan 5 – Apr 5, 2026 for a €4M renovation. Monte is still reachable by taxi, bus #20/#21, or car. The toboggan ride still operates.

### Trail Reservations are MANDATORY (SIMplifica)
Every classified PR trail now requires an online reservation via **[simplifica.madeira.gov.pt](https://simplifica.madeira.gov.pt)**. You pick a 30-minute entry slot from sunrise to sunset. Nature Wardens check QR codes at trailheads. Book 1-3 days ahead.

**Fees (2026):**
| Pass type | Price (age >12) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Single PR trail | €4.50 | Most trails |
| PR1 bundle (PR1/1.1/1.2/1.3) | €10.50 | Premium pricing |
| Day pass (2+ trails, excl. PR1) | €9.00 | |
| 3-day pass | €22.50 | |
| 7-day pass | €52.50 | |
| Children ≤12 | Free | Must still register |

**For 4 days doing 1 trail/day: individual €4.50 tickets are cheaper than passes.**

### Rent a Car
You NEED a car. Public transport won't get you to trailheads. March prices are rock-bottom: €10-15/day manual, €15-25/day automatic. Book automatic 3-6 weeks ahead. Get SCDW (zero excess coverage). Use local companies (Insular Car, AutoRentaCar) over international chains.

### March Weather Reality
- **Coast (Funchal):** 16-20°C, mostly dry, some rain
- **Mountains (Areeiro, 1818m):** 3-8°C, wind, fog, possible ice at dawn
- **North coast:** Roughly 2x the rain of south coast
- **Rule:** Check webcams every morning before committing to a plan
- **Webcams:** [webcammadeira.com](https://webcammadeira.com), [madeira.best/webcams](https://madeira.best/useful-info/webcams/)
- **Water temp:** 17-19°C (coldest month). Bracing but swimmable.

### No Uber
There is no Uber in Madeira. BOLT exists but is unreliable. Taxis are available (Funchal to Areeiro: €40-60 one-way). Rent a car.

---

## Base Strategy

### Option A (Recommended): One Base in Funchal
The island is compact. Everywhere is a day trip. Funchal has the best evenings, most restaurants, easiest pivot when weather changes.
- **Old Town:** Walk to restaurants, buzzy nightlife, Zona Velha bars
- **Lido area:** Quieter, ocean views, resort pools, good for hiking base
- They're 15 minutes apart on foot.

### Option B: Split Stay (3 Funchal + 2 elsewhere)
Only worth it if you want to minimize driving on west/north days.
- Best split: Funchal + **Saccharum in Calheta** (sunset rooftop bar, west coast access)
- Porto Moniz / Santana are day-trip destinations, not worth a hotel move for a 5-night trip.

---

## Region 1: Funchal & South Coast

The "logistics backbone" — best food, best evenings, best recovery/culture zone. Not where the big hike days happen, but where you eat, drink, and plan.

### Hikes
| Trail | Type | Time | Difficulty | Highlight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PR11 — Vereda dos Balcões | Out & back | 1.5h | Easy | Best view-to-effort ratio on the island. 1.5 km to a viewpoint over the central peaks |
| PR3.1 — Caminho Real do Monte | Point-to-point | 2h | Easy | Historic cobblestone path from Funchal to Monte |
| PR23 — Levada da Azenha | Loop | 2h | Easy | Quiet agricultural levada near Funchal |

### Must-See Viewpoints
- **Cabo Girão Skywalk** — 580m glass platform over the ocean. Free (possibly €2-5 in 2026). Go at golden hour, skip 10am-2pm (coach tour crowds). 15 min stop.
- **Eira do Serrado** — The iconic "Madeira is vertical" moment overlooking Curral das Freiras (Nun's Valley). Fog can kill it — check visibility. Free.
- **Miradouro do Paredão** — Higher, less-known angle on Nun's Valley. Steeper cliffs than Eira do Serrado. Free.

### Gardens
- **Monte Palace Tropical Garden** — €15, 2-3h. THE garden. Koi ponds, azulejo tiles, museum, wine tasting included. Get there by taxi/bus (cable car closed).
- **Palheiro Gardens** — €11, 1.5-2h. **Camellias in PEAK BLOOM in March.** This is THE time to go. English estate feel.
- **Jardim Botânico** — €6, 1.5-2h. 2000+ exotic plants, bird park, Funchal views.

### Swimming
- **Doca do Cavacas** — €6, volcanic pools between Lido and Praia Formosa. Snorkeling, restaurant, south coast = calmer.
- **Praia Formosa** — Free. Largest beach, pebble/dark sand, 2 km promenade. Blue Flag.
- **Fajã dos Padres** — €10-12 cable car. Secluded pebble beach at base of 300m cliff (below Cabo Girão). Pristine turquoise water, restaurant. Best hidden swim spot on the island.

### Day Loop Ideas
- **Loop S1 (Gardens + Monte):** Taxi to Monte → Monte Palace Garden → walk down through village → toboggan ride → Botanical Garden → Funchal
- **Loop S2 (Sunset Weapons-Grade):** Afternoon: Cabo Girão skywalk → Câmara de Lobos (Churchill's fishing village) → poncha at Bar Filhos D'Anjos → espetada dinner at Santo Antonio or As Vides in Estreito
- **Loop S3 (Mountain View, Low Effort):** Eira do Serrado → Curral das Freiras (chestnut dishes at Sabores do Curral) → Funchal
- **Loop S4 (Bad Weather Recovery):** Mercado dos Lavradores (morning) → Fábrica Santo António bakery → Blandy's Wine Lodge tasting → Zona Velha café crawl → Doca do Cavacas swim if brave

---

## Region 2: Central Mountains / High Peaks

The "you came to Madeira for this" zone. Above-the-clouds ridges, brutal vertical relief. Most weather-sensitive region.

### Hikes
| Trail | Type | Time | Difficulty | Highlight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PR1.2 — Vereda do Pico Ruivo | Out & back | 2.5-3h | Moderate | THE way to summit Pico Ruivo (1862m). Start from Achada do Teixeira. 5.6 km RT. Clear morning = above the clouds |
| PR1 — Vereda do Areeiro (partial) | Out & back | 1-1.5h | Easy-Moderate | Only 1.2 km open to Pedra Rija viewpoint. Still worth it for the ridge drama. €4.50 |
| PR17 — Caminho do Pináculo e Folhadal | Point-to-point | 5h | Hard | Highland forest trail. Great in "moody cloud" conditions. Connects Encumeada to Paul da Serra |
| PR12 — Caminho Real da Encumeada | Point-to-point | 5-6h | Hard | Historic "royal road" through mountain pass. Views of both north and south valleys |

### Must-See Viewpoints
- **Pico do Areeiro** — 1818m. Drive right up. Best at SUNRISE (above the clouds). Near-freezing at dawn — bring warm layers. Road can close in bad weather.
- **Bica da Cana** — 1560m. Alternative sunrise spot. Panoramic views east to Arieiro and Ruivo. Parking lot virtually empty.
- **Encumeada Pass** — 1007m. Two-sided views: north to São Vicente, south to Serra de Água. Rare "cloud waterfall" phenomenon when clouds spill over the pass. Often fogged by midday.

### Day Loop Ideas
- **Loop C1 (Clear-Sky Apex Day):** Pre-dawn drive to Pico do Areeiro → sunrise → PR1 partial (1.2 km to Pedra Rija) → drive to Achada do Teixeira → PR1.2 to Pico Ruivo summit → lunch at Quinta do Furão in Santana → Santana houses photo stop
- **Loop C2 (Moody Cloud Day):** Encumeada Pass viewpoint → PR17 (if conditions allow) → Taberna da Poncha in Serra d'Água (the island's most famous poncha bar, €3/glass) → viewpoints along return

---

## Region 3: East & Northeast

Your "coastal geology + lush forest" region. Stack São Lourenço (wild, windy, arid) with Queimadas/Caldeirão Verde (deep green levada magic).

### Hikes
| Trail | Type | Time | Difficulty | Highlight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PR8 — Ponta de São Lourenço | Out & back | 3-4h | Moderate | THE most visually dramatic hike. Arid peninsula, ocean both sides, volcanic colors. No shade — bring hat/sunscreen/water. Start early (parking fills by 10am) |
| PR9 — Levada do Caldeirão Verde | Out & back | 5-7h | Moderate-Hard | Peak "levada drama." Laurisilva forest + tunnels + waterfall amphitheater. Bring headlamp (multiple long tunnels). Start before 9am for fewer crowds |
| PR10 — Levada do Furado | Point-to-point | 5-6h | Moderate | Long levada crossing, deep forest immersion. Ribeiro Frio → Portela. Need taxi/two cars |
| PR11 — Vereda dos Balcões | Out & back | 1.5h | Easy | Short, huge payoff. Perfect "bonus hike" after PR10 or as fog-pivot when peaks fail |
| PR5 — Vereda das Funduras | Point-to-point | 4h | Moderate | Deeper east forest. Less "everyone does this" than PR8 |
| Vereda do Larano (unofficial) | Point-to-point | 4-5h | Moderate | THE most underrated hike in Madeira (Reddit consensus). Coastal cliffs, 300m drops, carved-into-cliff path at 4km mark. Machico → Porto da Cruz. FREE, no reservation |

### Must-See Viewpoints
- **Ponta do Rosto** — Start of PR8. Both north and south coasts visible. Volcanic colors (black, brown, red, ochre). 9/10.
- **Miradouro dos Balcões** — End of PR11. Views of central peaks from valley floor. Easy access. 9/10.
- **Miradouro do Guindaste (Faial)** — Sea-level glass walkways 26m over ocean. Unique low perspective. Free. 8/10.
- **Miradouro da Portela** — Sweeping valley + ocean panorama between Machico and Porto da Cruz. 8/10.

### Swimming
- **Prainha** — Madeira's ONLY natural sandy beach. Volcanic/coppery black sand in sheltered cove. Calm, clear water. Free. Near Caniçal. 8/10.
- **Porto da Cruz** — Surf beach. Penha d'Águia backdrop. Good waves, not for calm swimming.
- **Machico Beach** — Imported golden sand. Sheltered bay, family-friendly. Free.

### Towns & Culture
- **Santana** — Traditional A-frame thatched houses (quick photo stop). Base for Queimadas hikes.
- **Porto da Cruz** — Quiet village with seawater pool, Engenho do Norte rum distillery, surf. Hidden gem.
- **Machico** — Pleasant town, golden beach, restaurants.

### Day Loop Ideas
- **Loop E1 (East Peninsula + Towns):** PR8 São Lourenço (early, 8am start) → Prainha beach → Machico lunch at O Forno (garlic prawns, complimentary ginja) → Porto da Cruz → poncha at A Pipa (best on north coast, closed Sun/Mon)
- **Loop E2 (Deep Green Day):** PR9 Caldeirão Verde (start before 9am, bring headlamp) → Santana houses → Ribeiro Frio → PR11 Balcões viewpoint if energy remains
- **Loop E3 (Underrated Coastal):** Vereda do Larano (Machico → Porto da Cruz, FREE) → Porto da Cruz swim/poncha → viewpoints on return

## Region 4: West / Northwest

The "waterfall levada + ancient forest + lava pools" mega-zone. Maximum nature density.

### Hikes
| Trail | Type | Time | Difficulty | Highlight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PR6 — Levada das 25 Fontes | Out & back | 3-4h | Moderate | THE most famous waterfall levada. 800m tunnel (headlamp required). Ends at 25-spring lagoon. €4.50. Go early — gets crowded |
| PR6.1 — Levada do Risco | Out & back | 1.5-2h | Easy | Sibling to PR6, same start. Different waterfall. Easy combo |
| PR13 — Vereda do Fanal | Point-to-point | 4-5h | Moderate | Through the ancient laurel forest. Less crowded than PR6 |
| PR14 — Levada dos Cedros | Point-to-point | 5h | Moderate | Deep forest levada with waterfalls |
| Levada do Vento / Lagoa do Vento | Out & back | 3-4h | Moderate | Shorter, quieter, BIGGER waterfall than PR6. Near Rabaçal. Last 900m steep and slippery. Tour groups never make it here |

### Rabaçal Logistics
- **Shuttle required:** Private vehicles cannot drive down to Rabaçal trailhead. Park at the top and take the free shuttle (or walk 2.5 km down the road).
- **Shuttle hours:** Runs regularly during trail hours. Confirm schedule on arrival.
- **Parking:** Limited spaces at top. Arrive by 8:30am.
- **PR6 + PR6.1 combo:** Same start point. Do both in one day (4-5h total).

### Must-See: Fanal Forest
The ancient laurisilva laurel trees in fog. UNESCO World Heritage ecosystem. This is Madeira's most atmospheric spot — twisted ancient trees disappearing into mist.
- **Best conditions:** Early morning or post-rain fog. March = good timing (fog still common).
- **Note for 2026:** Fencing and designated paths being installed. You can no longer roam freely.
- GPS: 32.815211, -17.152339

### North Coast Stops
- **Porto Moniz Natural Pools** — Classic lava pools. €3 paid complex (lifeguards, facilities) or FREE Cachalote pools at town entrance (more raw, no lifeguard). 9/10.
- **Seixal Black Sand Beach** — "Jamaica Beach." Black sand beneath green cliffs with lava arch. 3rd best beach in Europe (2022 ranking). Photography 10/10, swimming risky in March.
- **Seixal Natural Pools** — Free volcanic pools with dramatic lava arch. Arguably more beautiful than Porto Moniz. No lifeguards. 9/10.
- **Véu da Noiva (Bridal Veil)** — Waterfall cascading from cliff into ocean. Quick photo stop en route to Porto Moniz. Best after rain. 8/10.
- **Ribeira da Janela** — Sea stacks rising from ocean. Dramatic rock formations. Large parking, facilities. 7/10.

### Day Loop Ideas
- **Loop W1 (Classic "I Flew Here For This"):** PR6 + PR6.1 at Rabaçal (arrive 8:30am) → Fanal forest → Porto Moniz pools → Véu da Noiva viewpoint → sunset drive back
- **Loop W2 (Forest-First, Fewer Crowds):** PR13 Vereda do Fanal → Levada do Vento (bigger waterfall, no crowds) → north coast viewpoints
- **Loop W3 (North Coast Photo Run):** Seixal black sand beach → Seixal natural pools → Véu da Noiva → Porto Moniz pools → Restaurante Orca (tuna steak, ocean views)
- **Loop W4 (Southwest Sunsets + Cliffs):** Calheta golden sand beach → Jardim do Mar village → Paul do Mar → Ponta do Pargo lighthouse at golden hour

## Region 5: Southwest & Hidden Gems

### Off-the-Beaten-Path Spots

**Achadas da Cruz Cable Car** (West coast) — Claimed as Europe's steepest cable car (98% initial slope). €3 return, cash only. 8am-7pm. Most tourists skip this. Hiking down instead offers wild views.

### Poncha Facts
Made with aguardente de cana (sugarcane rum) + honey + sugar + fresh citrus. Mixed with a wooden stick called a "caralhinho." ~50% rum masked by fruit sweetness. **Designate a driver.** Flavors: traditional lemon, passion fruit (maracujá), tangerine, "regional" (orange + sugarcane honey).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not renting a car** — Public transport can't reach trailheads. Mandatory.
2. **Arriving at trailheads after 9am** — Parking fills at PR8, PR6, Areeiro. Be there by 8-8:30am.
3. **Not booking SIMplifica** — You will be turned away. Book 1-3 days ahead.
4. **Following Google Maps blindly** — It routes you up insanely steep narrow roads. Stick to VE highways and newer tunnels.
5. **Expecting sandy beaches** — There are none (Calheta has imported sand). It's volcanic rock, pebble, and natural pools.
6. **Underestimating weather changes** — Sunshine in Funchal can mean fog 20 min away in mountains. Pack layers + rain gear EVERY day.
7. **Buying bottled poncha** — Drink it fresh at a bar. Bottled poncha is inferior.
8. **Not carrying cash** — Rural bars, cable cars (Achadas da Cruz €3, cash only), small establishments may be cash-only.
9. **Wearing flip-flops on levadas** — Even "easy" levadas have slippery sections, tunnels, uneven stone. Hiking shoes non-negotiable.
10. **Over-planning** — Madeira rewards flexibility. Check webcams each morning and pivot.
11. **Ignoring the north coast** — Most tourists stay south. North coast (Seixal, Porto da Cruz, Santana) is wilder, greener, less crowded.
12. **Skipping smaller villages** — Porto da Cruz, Jardim do Mar, Ponta do Sol have more character than any resort.

---

## Packing List (March)

### Essentials
- **Hiking shoes** with good grip (NOT sneakers, NOT sandals)
- **Rain jacket** — even on sunny days
- **Layers** — coast is 18°C, mountains can be 3°C
- **Headlamp/flashlight** — for tunnel levadas (PR9, PR6)
- **Sunscreen + hat** — PR8 has zero shade
- **Water bottle** — 1.5L minimum per hike
- **Small daypack** — for layers, water, snacks

### Nice to Have
- Water shoes (for natural pools — volcanic rock is sharp)
- Quick-dry towel (for spontaneous swims)
- Swimsuit
- Warm fleece/down layer (for Areeiro sunrise — near freezing)
- Portable charger
- Offline maps downloaded (Google Maps or maps.me)

### Don't Bother
- Umbrella (wind will destroy it on ridges)
- Hiking poles (most trails don't need them, levadas are flat)
- Heavy camera gear (phone is fine, weight matters on long hikes)

## Booking Workflow (Daily Routine)

**Each evening:**
1. Check [webcammadeira.com](https://webcammadeira.com) + [IPMA forecast](https://www.ipma.pt)
2. Decide: peaks day? coast day? forest day?
3. Book PR slots at [simplifica.madeira.gov.pt](https://simplifica.madeira.gov.pt) for next day
4. Screenshot the QR code (spotty signal at trailheads)

**Morning of:**
1. Recheck webcams (weather changes overnight)
2. If peaks are fogged → pivot to coast/forest plan
3. If forecast changed → you can cancel/rebook on SIMplifica
4. Leave by 7-7:30am for popular trailheads

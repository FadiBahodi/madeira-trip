# Madeira Accommodation Guide -- March 10-15, 2026

Last researched: February 2026. Prices are approximate for March 2026 (low season).

---

## SEASON & BOOKING CONTEXT

**March = Low Season (Good News for Your Wallet)**

- March is shoulder-to-low season. Expect hotel prices 30-50% below summer peaks.
- Weather: 16-20C daytime, 10C nights, ~6 hours sunshine/day, ~10 rainy days in the month (typically short showers that clear fast). South coast (Funchal) is sunnier; north coast is greener but wetter.
- Crowds are thin. You will not struggle to find availability unless you wait until last minute for top-tier properties.
- Booking.com and direct hotel sites often show best rates about 1 month out. Fridays tend to be cheapest nights.
- Savoy Palace offers a 10% discount for stays Jan-April 2026 when booking 8+ nights (not useful for your 5-night trip, but worth asking if they have any March promos).

## FUNCHAL -- LUXURY / SPLURGE (200+ EUR/night)

### 1. Savoy Palace

**What it is:** The biggest, flashiest 5-star in Funchal. Opened 2019. 352 rooms. Member of Leading Hotels of the World.

**What makes it special:**
- Largest spa in Portugal (Laurea Spa, 3,000 sqm) -- connected to indoor/outdoor pool complex with waterfalls
- Two rooftop infinity pools (one exclusive to suite guests) with Atlantic panoramas
- 5 on-site restaurants
- Architecture is dramatic -- tropical plants integrated into modern glass/concrete, feels intimate despite its size
- Rated 9.3 on Booking.com

**Room types:**
- Superior Ocean Room (queen/twin, private balcony, ocean view) -- starting ~185 EUR/night in March
- One-Bedroom Ocean Suite (lounge + dining area, walk-in shower or shower+bathtub)
- Superior Ocean Suite (wrap-around balcony)
- "The Reserve" -- hotel-within-a-hotel concept for top-tier suites with private pool access

**Honest pros:**
- Facilities are genuinely best-in-class for Funchal -- pool, spa, dining all under one roof
- Despite size, doesn't feel corporate. Staff gets consistent praise
- Location in Sao Martinho/Lido area -- walking distance to seafront promenade
- Rooms are large, quiet, modern

**Honest cons:**
- Pool sunbed charges of ~90 EUR (!!) reported by some guests, not communicated upfront
- Spa access may cost extra on top of room rate depending on booking type
- No direct sea access -- you need to go to their sister property (Royal Savoy) for that
- It's a big hotel. If you want boutique intimacy, this is not it
- Some "Vegas-like" descriptions -- it's designed to impress, which can feel impersonal to some

**March price estimate:** 185-350 EUR/night depending on room type

---

### 2. Reid's Palace (Belmond)

**What it is:** THE iconic Madeira hotel. Open since 1891. Perched on a cliff overlooking Funchal harbour. This is where Churchill painted. Where afternoon tea is a tradition. 158 rooms.

**Worth the price?**
Rated 9.7 on Booking.com (968 reviews). That is an exceptional score. The consensus across multiple sources: expensive, but genuinely delivers.

**What you get:**
- Cliff-top location with panoramic views of mountains and Funchal harbour from nearly every window
- William Restaurant (Michelin-starred)
- Famous afternoon tea on the terrace
- Free breakfast, free WiFi, free parking (notable -- most luxury hotels charge for parking)
- Pool carved into the cliff face
- Old-world elegance that no modern hotel can replicate -- think polished wood, antiques, gardens
- Staff service described as "highest caliber" across reviews

**Room tips:**
- Sea-view rooms are the entire point. Do not book a garden-view room here -- you're paying for the clifftop panorama
- Suites with private terraces are the real splurge if budget allows
- The hotel has been renovated progressively by Belmond -- rooms mix heritage character with modern comfort

**Honest pros:**
- Irreplaceable atmosphere and history. Nothing else on the island competes on heritage
- Service is consistently world-class (Belmond standard)
- Free parking is a real bonus if you have a rental car
- Location is dramatic and photogenic
- Dining is outstanding

**Honest cons:**
- Most expensive option on this list. Expect 300-500+ EUR/night in March
- Can feel stuffy or "old money" if that's not your vibe -- dress codes for dinner
- Not walkable to Old Town easily (it's on its own promontory) -- you're somewhat isolated
- Pool area is smaller than Savoy's
- Some of the "classic" room categories can feel dated compared to the suites

**March price estimate:** 300-550 EUR/night

---

### 3. The Cliff Bay (Porto Bay)

**What it is:** 5-star oceanfront property in the Lido area. 200 rooms. Known for direct ocean access, Michelin-starred dining, and a more serene vibe than Savoy.

**Why choose this over Savoy?**
- Direct sea access (saltwater pool at ocean level + beach platform). Savoy has no direct sea access.
- Il Gallo d'Oro -- Madeira's first and only Michelin-starred restaurant (2 stars)
- More intimate, garden-focused atmosphere vs Savoy's modern flashiness
- Walking distance to Lido promenade restaurants
- Ranked #3 in Madeira by Tripexpert with endorsements from Oyster, Frommer's, and The Telegraph

**Les Suites at The Cliff Bay:** Newer addition -- more exclusive suite-only wing with its own pool and premium amenities.

**Honest pros:**
- Ocean access is the killer feature. Swimming platform at the base of the cliff
- Michelin dining on-site (Il Gallo d'Oro)
- Quieter, more mature atmosphere
- Great Lido location with restaurants nearby
- Gardens and grounds are beautiful

**Honest cons:**
- Facilities (spa, gym, pool complex) are smaller than Savoy
- Standard rooms in the main building can feel a generation older in design
- Less "wow factor" on arrival than Savoy's dramatic lobby
- If you want nightlife or energy, this is too serene

**March price estimate:** 200-400 EUR/night

---

### 4. Quinta da Casa Branca

**What it is:** Boutique 5-star on a historic wine estate. 43 rooms total. Member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World. Set in 28,000 sqm of subtropical gardens.

**The vibe:** You're staying in a private estate that happens to be a hotel. Tropical gardens, a restored manor house, quiet elegance. Anti-resort.

**Accommodation options:**
- Modern "Quinta" building -- 38 rooms. Comfortable but reportedly a bit small and somewhat dated
- Manor House Suites -- 5 luxury suites in the original historic building. These are the ones to book if budget allows

**Dining:**
- Casa da Quinta Restaurant & Bar (casual a la carte)
- The Dining Room in the Manor House (fine dining, opulent setting)
- Breakfast is universally praised -- fresh, extensive, cooked-to-order

**Location:** Lido area of western Funchal. 2km from city centre. 15-min walk to Old Town. Surrounded by shops and restaurants.

**Honest pros:**
- Most unique atmosphere of any Funchal hotel -- feels like a private garden estate
- Two outdoor pools (one adults-only)
- Breakfast is exceptional
- Staff is warm and attentive (boutique-scale service)
- Gardens alone are worth the visit

**Honest cons:**
- Standard "Quinta building" rooms are on the small side and showing age
- Only 43 rooms total -- can book out, though March should be fine
- No ocean views or sea access
- Fine dining is good but not Michelin-level
- For the price, the dated standard rooms can feel like a disconnect

**March price estimate:** 150-280 EUR/night (Manor House suites at the high end)

---

## FUNCHAL -- MID-RANGE (80-200 EUR/night)

### 5. Castanheiro Boutique Hotel

**What it is:** 81-room boutique hotel in the absolute center of Funchal's historic district. 4-star.

**Location is the headline:** Two steps from main shops, museums, restaurants, bars. Walking distance to harbour, farmers market, everything. This is the most central hotel on this list.

**Honest cons:**

**March price estimate:** 99-160 EUR/night

---

**Highlights:**
- Rooftop infinity pool with stunning views
- UVA Restaurant -- French-Madeiran fusion, highly rated
- Wine Therapy Spa
- Minimalist, modern interiors -- very different aesthetic from traditional Madeira hotels
- Central location near attractions

**Honest pros:**
- Design-forward, stylish -- feels like a city boutique hotel
- Rooftop pool area with bar is a highlight
- Restaurant is genuinely good (not just hotel-good)
- Location in the heart of Funchal

**Honest cons:**
- Rooms lean toward compact
- Pool is small
- Design-hotel aesthetic may feel cold to some

**March price estimate:** 120-200 EUR/night

---

### 7. Porto Santa Maria (PortoBay) -- Adults Only

**What it is:** 146-room hotel in Funchal's Old Town, right on the waterfront. Adults only.

**Location standout:** 30+ good restaurants within 3-minute walk. Right in the pedestrianized Old Town zone. Arguably the best restaurant-access location in Funchal.

**Notable feature:** All rooms have kitchenettes (sink, 2-burner stove, mini-fridge, kettle, cookware). Useful for keeping costs down.

**Honest pros:**
- Old Town location is magical -- cobblestone streets, painted doors, Mercado dos Lavradores nearby
- Kitchenette means you can do breakfast/snacks in-room
- Beachside location with scenic views
- Adults-only means quiet
- Strong reviews for cleanliness

**Honest cons:**
- Furnishings are dated in some rooms
- No big resort facilities (pool is small)
- "Three-and-a-half pearl" rating on Oyster -- slightly below the competition
- Old Town can be noisy at night (restaurants, bars)

**March price estimate:** 100-170 EUR/night

---

### 8. Porto Mare (PortoBay)

**What it is:** 198-room resort hotel in the Vila Porto Mare complex. 4-star feel with extensive facilities.

**The facilities pitch:** 4 restaurants, 4 bars, 1 ice cream parlour, 5 pools, spa, sports fields, children's play areas. This is "all-in-one resort" for Funchal.

**Honest pros:**
- Huge range of on-site facilities for the price
- Free shuttle to Funchal center throughout the day + bus stop outside
- Great for families or those who want resort vibes
- Beautiful grounds

**Honest cons:**
- Located outside the city center (10-min bus ride)
- Furnishings are dated and need refresh (multiple reviews)
- Some front desk staff get mixed reviews
- Can feel like a package-holiday resort

**March price estimate:** 100-165 EUR/night

---

### 9. Hotel Madeira Panoramico

**What it is:** 132-room 4-star hotel on the west hillside of Funchal. The name says it all -- views.

**Honest pros:**
- Stunning panoramic views of Funchal, the bay, and mountains
- Activities on-site: tennis, squash
- Free shuttle service to attractions
- Live music and dancing (social atmosphere)
- Breakfast is well-regarded
- Good value at the lower end of mid-range

**Honest cons:**
- Tucked-away hillside location -- you need transport to reach most attractions
- Rooms are dated (mismatched carpets and linens mentioned)
- No restaurants or bars in the immediate walking vicinity
- Better for relaxation-seekers than explorers
- Unexpected extra charges reported

**March price estimate:** 80-130 EUR/night

---

## FUNCHAL -- BUDGET-SMART (Under 80 EUR/night)

### 10. Best Hostels

**Santa Maria Hostel** -- In a renovated school building in the historic center. Close to beach and all city sights. Social atmosphere.

**Funchal109** -- Old Town location, 19th-century building with original architecture preserved. One of the cheapest on the island. Right in the action.

**Jaca Hostel** -- Sao Pedro district. Good for digital nomads. Bright rooms, comfy beds, walking distance to marina. Excellent ratings for location and cleanliness.

**29 Madeira Hostel** -- 21 rooms. 5-min drive from the Cathedral.

**Price range:** 20-50 EUR/night for dorms, 50-80 EUR for private rooms.

### 11. Budget Guesthouses

**A ver o mar** -- Santa Luzia district. Sea and mountain views from balcony. Kitchen access. Coworking/coliving space. Good for longer stays.

**Residencial Funchal** -- Zona Velha (Old Town). Twin rooms, budget-friendly, right by the painted doors and Mercado dos Lavradores.

**Hotel Orquidea** -- Frequently recommended as best budget hotel option in Funchal.

**Price range:** 40-75 EUR/night

### 12. Airbnb Areas to Target

**Old Town (Zona Velha)** -- Best for walkability, restaurants, nightlife. 2 minutes from everything. Expect refurbished flats from ~90 EUR/night for a 1-bed with character.

**City Center (around the Cathedral / Blandy's Wine Lodge)** -- Walk to all major Funchal attractions. Good selection of renovated apartments.

**Sao Pedro** -- Historic neighborhood near Cathedral and Cruzes Museum. Good restaurants, slightly quieter than Old Town.

**Lido area** -- More residential, quieter, ocean-facing. Slightly further from the action but better views and more space for the money.

**Price range:** 50-120 EUR/night for a decent 1-bed apartment. March prices are soft.

---

## OUTSIDE FUNCHAL -- SPLIT STAY OPTIONS

### Porto Moniz Area

**Aqua Natura Bay** -- 4-star, right by the famous natural volcanic pools (free access for guests year-round).

- Modern rooms with ocean + mountain views
- Friendly staff, good breakfast variety
- Free parking (easy)
- Rated well on Booking.com with recent positive reviews (March 2025: "impeccable, excellent reception")
- Price: ~100-140 EUR/night in March

**Honest take:** Porto Moniz is a nice place to spend one night to enjoy the pools without day-tripper crowds (they leave by late afternoon). But multiple forum posts say "nice to visit for an hour or so, wouldn't base myself there." Limited dining options. One night is enough.

---

### Santana Area

**Quinta do Furao** -- 4-star cliff-edge property with dramatic north-coast views.

- Stunning views of northeast coast and surrounding mountains
- Set within 5 acres of organic gardens
- Close to levadas and Pico Ruivo trails -- great for hikers
- Excellent breakfast, pool, sauna, massage room
- Sustainable practices (solar-heated water, wall-mounted dispensers not plastic)
- Friendly, helpful staff

**Honest cons:**
- Restaurant quality is inconsistent (dinner service gets mixed reviews)
- Spa feels outdated
- Santana itself is mostly visited by day-trippers who leave by late afternoon -- evenings are very quiet
- Limited evening dining options in town
- Price: ~90-140 EUR/night in March

**Honest take:** Beautiful property, but Santana is better as a day trip than an overnight base. Multiple sources say this.

---

### Calheta Area

**Saccharum Resort & Spa** (Savoy Signature) -- 243 rooms on Madeira's southwest coast. Next to the marina and sandy beach.

- **Sunset views are the headline.** West-facing coast = unforgettable sunsets from your balcony, the Fly rooftop bar, or the infinity pool
- All rooms have private balconies, majority ocean-facing
- Infinity pool + children's pool
- Spa and wellness facilities
- Part of the Savoy Signature family (same management as Savoy Palace)

**Honest pros:**
- Sunset views are genuinely spectacular and the #1 reason to stay here
- Modern, elegant design
- Good pool setup with plenty of loungers
- Sandy beach nearby (rare for Madeira)

**Honest cons:**
- Noise issues reported in some rooms
- Staff service is inconsistent (mixed reviews)
- Extra charges for spa/amenities can add up
- Calheta itself is small -- limited dining and nightlife outside the hotel
- Room mislabeling reported occasionally

**Price:** ~130-190 EUR/night in March

---

### Sao Vicente Area

**Estalagem do Vale** -- Charming country-house inn in the Laurissilva Forest setting.

- Surrounded by mountains, feels like a genuine retreat
- Restaurant (O Caramujo) offers set dinner menu for 20 EUR -- excellent value
- Pool, garden, reflexology, mini-golf
- Good hiking and biking base
- Staff praised as welcoming and attentive
- Rated 8.4/10 on Booking.com

**Honest cons:**
- Rooms are noisy -- slamming doors from 7am and late evening is a recurring complaint
- Feels tired and below 4-star standard despite the classification
- Remote location
- Limited facilities

**Price:** From ~37-80 EUR/night (genuine budget option outside Funchal)

**Better strategic choice for Sao Vicente:** The town itself is centrally located on the north coast, right by the island's central tunnel -- 30 minutes to Funchal. If you want a north-coast night, Sao Vicente is the most practical base for reaching both coasts.

---

## KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### Is a split stay worth it, or does it waste too much time?

**For a 5-night trip (Mar 10-15), my honest assessment: Funchal base only is the safest bet.**

Arguments for staying in Funchal the whole time:
- The island is small. Nowhere is more than ~1.5 hours by car from Funchal
- Funchal has the best transport links, restaurants, and evening options
- Packing/unpacking/checking in/out eats into a short trip
- Day trips to Porto Moniz, Santana, Calheta etc. are totally doable from Funchal

Arguments for splitting (1-2 nights outside):
- Staying in Porto Moniz lets you enjoy the natural pools at sunset/sunrise without crowds
- A night in Calheta/Saccharum gives you those west-coast sunsets
- The north coast (Sao Vicente) feels like a different island -- greener, wilder, quieter
- You avoid one long return drive on a hiking day

**Practical compromise:** If you split, do 3 nights Funchal + 1 night Calheta (sunset) or Porto Moniz (pools). Do NOT split into more than 2 bases on a 5-night trip. Santana and Sao Vicente are better as day trips.

---

### Best neighborhoods in Funchal for a hotel?

**Old Town (Zona Velha)** -- Best for: walkability, restaurant density, atmosphere, culture. The painted doors street (Rua de Santa Maria), Mercado dos Lavradores, waterfront bars. Buzzy at night. Best if you want to walk everywhere and eat out.

**Lido / Sao Martinho** -- Best for: luxury hotels, ocean views, resort vibes, promenade walking. This is where Savoy Palace, Cliff Bay, Quinta da Casa Branca all sit. Quieter, more residential. 15-min walk or quick bus to Old Town. Best if you want a resort base with excursion days.

**City Center (around Cathedral)** -- Best for: mid-range stays, being equidistant from everything. Castanheiro and The Vine are here. Best compromise between Old Town atmosphere and Lido resort calm.

**My recommendation for your trip:** Old Town if you want to eat out and explore on foot. Lido/Sao Martinho if you want a luxury base to return to after hiking days. Either works -- they're 15 minutes apart on foot.

---

### Breakfast included vs. eating out?

**Take the breakfast if it's included or cheap to add.** Here's why:

- Hotel breakfasts in Madeira are generally excellent -- fresh fruit, local pastries, eggs cooked to order, cheese, charcuterie. Reid's, Castanheiro, Quinta da Casa Branca, and Quinta do Furao all get singled out for great breakfasts
- Eating breakfast out in Funchal is possible and affordable (cafes from 5-10 EUR) but options before 9am are limited, and you're losing hiking time
- If your hotel charges 15-25 EUR extra per person for breakfast, compare that to what you'd spend at a cafe. Often it's a wash, but the hotel is faster and more convenient for early hiking starts
- Porto Santa Maria's kitchenettes are a middle ground -- grab pastries and fruit from the market the night before

**Exception:** If you're in an Airbnb, stock up at the Pingo Doce supermarket or Mercado dos Lavradores. Fresh Madeiran fruit for breakfast is hard to beat.

---

### Parking at hotels?

**Critical if you're renting a car (and you should on Madeira).**

| Hotel | Parking | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Reid's Palace | Free parking | Included |
| Savoy Palace | Available | Likely 10-20 EUR/day |
| Cliff Bay | Available | Check at booking |
| Quinta da Casa Branca | Available | Check at booking |
| Castanheiro | Limited (city center) | Likely paid, ~15 EUR/day |
| Aqua Natura Bay (Porto Moniz) | Free, easy | Included |
| Quinta do Furao (Santana) | Free, easy | Included |
| Saccharum (Calheta) | Available | Check at booking |

**Key points:**
- Street parking in Funchal city is nearly impossible and nothing is free
- Hotels outside Funchal almost always have free, easy parking
- If parking cost matters, factor it into your hotel comparison. Reid's offering free parking at 300+ EUR/night is a nice touch. Savoy charging 15-20 EUR/day on top of 200+ EUR is less fun
- Budget for ~15 EUR/day if your hotel charges, or choose a hotel with free parking

---

## TOP PICKS BY STRATEGY

### "Money is no object" pick
**Reid's Palace.** Nothing else on the island matches the history, views, service, and Michelin dining. Free parking and breakfast sweeten it. March rate might dip below 300 EUR/night for entry rooms.

### "Best all-round luxury" pick
**Savoy Palace.** Best facilities (spa, pools, restaurants) of any hotel in Funchal. Modern, impressive, consistent. Just watch out for hidden charges.

### "Best value in Funchal" pick
**Castanheiro Boutique Hotel.** Central location, modern rooms, rooftop pool, excellent breakfast, from ~99 EUR. Hard to beat the location-quality-price triangle.

### "Best atmosphere" pick
**Quinta da Casa Branca.** Nothing else feels like staying on a private tropical estate. Book the Manor House suite if you can.

### "Best for foodies" pick
**The Cliff Bay.** Il Gallo d'Oro (2 Michelin stars) on-site, plus direct ocean access, plus the serene garden atmosphere.

### "Best outside-Funchal night" pick
**Saccharum in Calheta.** One night for those west-coast sunsets from the rooftop bar, then back to Funchal.

### "Best budget play" pick
**Porto Santa Maria.** Old Town location, kitchenette saves on food costs, adults-only calm, from ~100 EUR.

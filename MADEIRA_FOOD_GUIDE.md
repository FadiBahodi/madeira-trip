**Location:** Rua Latino Coelho, Old Town Funchal
**Hours:** Monday-Friday 7am-4pm, Saturday 7am-2pm. Closed Sundays.

### What to Buy (Worth It)

**Fish Market (Basement/Ground Level)**
- Fresh espada (black scabbardfish) -- unique to Madeira, with huge eyes from deep-sea pressure.
- Fresh tuna, swordfish, octopus.
- **Best time:** Early morning (by 8am) for freshest catch.
- **Verdict:** Genuinely excellent. Not overpriced.

**Flowers (Ground Floor)**
- Strelitzia (bird of paradise), orchids, proteas -- many species only found in Madeira or South Africa.
- **Verdict:** Wonderful quality, reasonable prices.

**Upper Floor (First Floor)**
- This is where LOCALS shop. Fruits and vegetables at reasonable prices.
- Go here for: passion fruit (maracuja), cherimoya/custard apple (anona), tiny Madeiran bananas, seasonal tropical fruits.
- **Verdict:** Much better prices than ground floor.

### What to Avoid (Tourist Traps)

**Ground Floor Fruit Sellers**
- Aggressive sales tactics: offer free samples, then before you know it you walk away with a full bag you never intended to buy. They mix old/rotten fruit in with good ones.
- Prices of EUR 20-25 per kilo for fruit.
- They don't give you a moment to think and throw in "gifts" (usually unripe peaches) to close the sale.
- **Rule:** ALWAYS ask the price before tasting or touching anything. Do NOT accept "free" samples unless you're prepared to buy.

### Insider Tips
1. **Go to the first floor** -- that's where locals buy. Ground floor is for tourists.
2. **Visit on Friday morning** for the busiest, most authentic experience.
3. **Avoid when cruise ships are in port** -- peak tourist rush, highest prices.
4. **Bring cash** -- some vendors don't accept cards for small purchases.
5. **Early morning** (7-8am) is best for the fish market.
6. **The building itself** is worth seeing for its Art Deco architecture (1940, designed by Edmundo Tavares).

## 8. WINE TASTING

### Madeira Wine Basics

Four noble grape varieties from dry to sweet:

1. **Sercial (Dry)** -- Citrus, green apple, almond, subtle salty note. High acidity. Best as aperitif or with fish/soup. Serve slightly chilled.
2. **Verdelho (Medium-Dry)** -- Smoky, slightly richer than Sercial. Elegant fruit. Pairs with seafood bisque, smoked foods. Serve slightly chilled.
3. **Boal/Bual (Medium-Sweet)** -- Intense perfume. Roasted coffee, caramel, cocoa flavors. Balance of acidity and sweetness. Serve at room temperature with hard cheese, dried fruit, cake.
4. **Malmsey/Malvasia (Sweet)** -- Sweetest and fruitiest. Nutty, chocolate notes. Serve at room temperature with rich fruit cake, chocolate desserts, coffee.

**Tip:** If a label shows one of these four varieties, it's a quality indicator. Look for age statements: 5-year, 10-year, 15-year, 20-year, or vintage/frasqueira (single harvest).

## PRACTICAL TIPS

### Meal Times
- **Lunch:** 12:30-3:00 PM (this is the main meal in Madeira)
- **Dinner:** 7:00-9:00 PM
- Many restaurants close between lunch and dinner.

### Tipping
- Appreciated but not mandatory. Staff earn lower wages and rely on tips.
- 5-10% is standard for good service.

### Service Style
- Leisurely paced. Don't expect North American speed. Relax into it.

### Reservations
- Essential for: Michelin-starred restaurants, weekend dinners at popular spots, Santo Antonio, Vila do Peixe.
- Not needed for: Casual snack bars, weekday lunches at budget spots.

### Budget Eating
- Look for "prato do dia" (dish of the day) at local restaurants -- typically EUR 7-12 including drink.
- Snack bars (tascas) are family-run affairs serving quality homemade food at very low prices.
- Markets and bakeries for breakfast/snacks.

### Drinks
- **Coral** is the local beer. Order it everywhere.
- **Poncha** is the cocktail. Start with traditional lemon, then explore.
- **Nikita** is beer + vanilla ice cream + pineapple juice -- sounds weird, tastes refreshing.
- **Madeira wine** as aperitif (Sercial) or digestif (Malmsey).

### March Weather Consideration
- March is shoulder season. Some mountain restaurants may have limited hours.
- Mountain areas can be cooler and foggy -- restaurants with fireplaces (Cantinho da Serra, Quinta do Furao) are ideal for these days.
- Coastal restaurants are generally pleasant year-round.
